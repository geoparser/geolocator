<PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE> rover is launched on voyage to look for evidence of water

A rocket holding the first of two <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE> rovers blasted off Tuesday on
a seven-month voyage to the red <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-14" type="CELESTIAL">planet</PLACE> where the golf-cart-sized
vehicles will search for evidence that there was once enough water to
support life on <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-3" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE>.

The rover named Spirit lifted off from the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:280995" id="Pl-12" latLong="28.406°N 80.605°W" predicative="true" state="US-FL" type="PPL">Cape Canaveral</PLACE> <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-234" state="US-FL" type="FAC">Air Force
Station</PLACE> aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket at 1:58 p.m. (1758 GMT).

Thunderstorms delayed the launch by two days, and launch officials
contended with a last-minute communications glitch between stations
that will track the spacecraft.

The second rover, named Opportunity, will be launched later this
month, and both are expected to arrive at <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-4" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE> in January.

Moving on six wheels, the $800 million rovers act as robotic
geologists. Each is equipped with a panoramic camera, a camera for
close-up views of rocks and a drill to cut into rocks. The data will
be transmitted back to <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-15" type="CELESTIAL">Earth</PLACE>.

Previous missions have shown <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-5" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE> had water in the past, but
scientists want to find out how long the water was there and in what
quantities. Scientists believe the water may show that <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-6" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE> once was
able to support life.

The rovers' landing sites, on opposite sides of the planet, were
chosen for their likelihood of holding evidence of water. Studying
the minerals in rocks can tell scientists how the rocks were formed,
whether they were ever submerged in water, and whether hot water ever
ran over them.

The rovers are expected to travel up to 132 feet (39.6 meters) each
<PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-16" predicative="true" type="CELESTIAL">Martian</PLACE> day, which is 24 hours and 39{ minutes long.

The missions are expected to last three months but could run longer.
The rovers eventually will shut down as dust builds up on their solar
panels and they will remain on the planet.

Only 12 out of 30 previous attempts have reached <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-7" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE>, and only three
out of nine attempts have succeeded in landing on the planet.

NASA revamped its <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE> program after the failure of two unmanned
missions to <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-9" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE> four years ago.

The space agency has been under intense scrutiny since February when
the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated over <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" state="US-TX" type="CIVIL">Texas</PLACE>, killing all
seven crew members. A logo patch of that last Columbia mission was
attached to both <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-10" predicative="true" type="CELESTIAL">Mars</PLACE> rovers.	    _	_  _  =
