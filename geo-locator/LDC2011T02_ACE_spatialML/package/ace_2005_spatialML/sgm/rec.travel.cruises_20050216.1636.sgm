 Renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise 

Has anybody out there seen this done?
I saw somewhere on their site there is a lot of prep time needed to get
married onboard.
I wonder if its easier just renewing your vows as my wife has been
looking for this for a while.
going out on the Sensation in March for our 18th anniverary.

 Re: Renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise 

My wife and I were guests at a wedding on the Carnival Legend on New
Years Eve 2003. All the guests were folks who had met the bride and
groom (an attractive young couple who were sailing alone) virtually on
cruisecritic. The wedding took place in the afternoon, before the ship
set sail. Thus, the couple was actual married by a justice of the peace
in the state of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-1" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">Florida</PLACE>. It was a great way to begin a cruise.

Although I am not certain of this, I assume that renewing your vows
could actually be done while the ship was at sea, because it would not
involve any legal issues.

I don't know the details, but on my last cruise there was a LARGE
wedding going on. The bride was all decked out in her long gown and
veil, groom in tux and the other wedding party all dressed to the nines!
They had one of the larger lounges closed off for a private reception. I
didn't think it was allowed any more, but 30 minutes until sailing an
announcement was made that all NON CRUISE guests must make their way to
disembark the ship prior to sailing. I had never heard that announcement
before so I assumed that it was for the people attending the wedding on
board? This was the largest wedding gathering I have ever seen on
board... maybe someone had connections??? The bride was still visible
later into the evening still wearing her wedding gown on the Lido Deck!

On 16 Feb 2005 13:36:29 -0800,

    

We renewed our vows on Carnival Conquest on 10/31/2004 - you need to
contact Carnival wedding department and ask if they have any
wedding/renewal packages available. These usally take a little time to
set up -if you are going in March I am not sure if/what would be
available to you.

They were just starting a new Renewal of Vows program, which included
all we rec'd, but was cheaper. Since we had already paid for our
package we kept it. Had a very nice ceremony with a justice of the
peace and a small reception for the family members traveling with us.

Call Carnival Wedding Dept. at 1(800) 933-4968 or send an email to:

weddi...@carnival.com

Happy anniversary and enjoy your cruise!
