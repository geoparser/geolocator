I've been keeping a careful eye on the Blockbuster / <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-2" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Hollywood</PLACE>
machinations for a while (and well I should -- I have stock in one of
the deal's participants, Movie Gallery ), but even so I'm surprised that
Blockbuster's latest gambit is to buy up <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-3" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Hollywood</PLACE>'s debt . It's an
admirable hedge -- if Movie Gallery wins, it could improve <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-4" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Hollywood</PLACE>'s
rating, and either way it offers Blockbuster some leverage. And this is,
as far as I know, the first time since the Allegheny deal that there's
been a hostile takeover using debt.
