New Questions About Attacking <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary?

<TEXT>


 NOVAK 
OK. Question from the audience.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Hi. I'm Paul Avalar (ph) from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:13233" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.415°N 111.909°W" state="US-AZ" type="PPL">Tempe</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-3" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="US-AZ" type="CIVIL">Arizona</PLACE>. I had a question also about
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. And now how are people going to argue that the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> can no longer both fight a war with <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> and also fight terrorism,
specifically al Qaeda?


 NOVAK 
That's a great question. It's an unanswerable point. He hasn't been able
to answer it. And Tom Andrews (ph) wasn't able to answer it.


 BEGALA 
Look, we need allies to catch these guys. We got him because the
Pakistanis got him. We didn't get him. We go to war in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, 200,000
people start protesting in <PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17229029" id="Pl-8" latLong="30.000°N 70.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Pakistan</PLACE>, they put too much pressure on the
government. It becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate with
us like they're cooperating now. We go to war in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, it would be the
worst thing we can do...


 NOVAK 
You know the one thing the Democrats can't stand is good news. It is just
something you cannot handle.


 BEGALA 
No. What I can't stand is a president who is going to screw up our war
against terrorism when I thought that was his job. From the left, I'm
Paul Begala. Good night for CROSSFIRE.


 NOVAK 
From the right, I'm Robert Novak. Join us again next time for another
edition of CROSSFIRE.
