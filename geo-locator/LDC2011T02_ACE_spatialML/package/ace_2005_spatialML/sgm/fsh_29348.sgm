5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in
a <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-12" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" state="75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> <PLACE id="Pl-60" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help or
hurt the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>-<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?
What do you think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> policy should be toward <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE> now that Arafat
has died? What, if anything, should the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> do to be involved in the
<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-16" type="RGN">Middle East</PLACE> peace process?


 Rainia 
Hello.


 Paul 
Hi, this is Paul.


 Rainia 
Hi.  Where are you from?


 Paul 
I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780781" id="Pl-17" latLong="39.000°N 75.500°W" state="DE" type="CIVIL">Delaware</PLACE>.


 Rainia 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780781" id="Pl-18" latLong="39.000°N 75.500°W" state="DE" type="CIVIL">Delaware</PLACE>.  And my name is Rainia and I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:278605" id="Pl-19" latLong="40.802°N 124.162°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Eureka</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-20" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>.


 Paul 
Wow.  Opposite sides of the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" mod="BORDER" type="COUNTRY">coast</PLACE>.


 Rainia 
Yeah.  Well, that's an interesting question they're asking.


 Paul 
Yeah, it is, uh,  the past couple of topics have been -- more
controversial than -- the early topics -- and, uh,  well,  I'm- I'm very
opinionated. I'm happy to talk about it.


 Rainia 
Yeah, go right ahead.


 Paul 
Well,  um,  Yasser Arafat was -- was he a good leader?  I I think -- that,
uh,  he -- he's -- pretty much -- -- or he was pretty much -- following what
he had always done, even as a young man,  uh, back in <PLACE country="DZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20336619" id="Pl-22" latLong="28.000°N 3.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Algeria</PLACE> -- when-
when he led the -- terrorist attacks against the <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-24" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">French</PLACE> to kick them out
of -- <PLACE country="DZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20336619" id="Pl-23" latLong="28.000°N 3.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Algeria</PLACE>.  And I- I think he was doing the same thing there in
<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE>.  I- I don't think,  eh,  I don't think he really knew how
to,  uh, take on the role of- of peacemaker.  You know, I'm- I'm --
you know, I could be wrong. That's just my opinion.  But i- it seems
like that- that was always a problem for him.  Hm.


 Rainia 
Yeah.  Um,  I'm not sure myself uh how good a leader he was. I I -- it's
hard to get the truth w- when the -- when the there's so many uh
slanted uh -- information


 Paul 
Yeah.


 Rainia 
especially on the main media.


 Paul 
That's true.


 Rainia 
I don't -- like the way -- <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> has been -- going after the Palestinians


 Paul 
Right. I- I agree. I think Ariel Sharon is a lot like Yasser Arafat.
And I -- can't understand why the two of them -- didn't see the
similarities.


 Rainia 
Yeah.  Um,  and they were asking -- too, of -- about the, should the ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
be involved -- in that whole thing?


 Paul 
Yeah. That- that's interesting, too, because -- cutting Yasser Arafat
out of the whole thing was- -- was really -- George Bush's decision.  I
think -- personally,  he didn't like him because he thought he was a- -- a
liar -- so he refused to -- have anything to do with him.  And, uh, th-


 Rainia 
Uh, which- which Bush are you talking about?


 Paul 
George ~W Bush.


 Rainia 
Oh, ok- yeah.


 Paul 
(())


 Rainia 
Well-


 Paul 
Ev- everything kind of stopped when- -- when he became president and
all,  uh,  activity regarding -- <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-8" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>, <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE> stopped.  And <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-9" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>
pretty much could do what they wanted.  An- and you're right, it
didn't seem fair at all.


 Rainia 
Yeah, there're -- th- well,  the way I see it, eh, Bush, eh,  has a
right -- wing Christian, right-wing agenda.  He he's -- some -- how thinks
that -- if <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-10" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> has -- -- I'm not sure that all -- their prophecies are
-- but there's something about -- if -- they can -- get rid of the
Palestinians, that will somehow,  um,  their prophecy -- coming true and
th- and then -- somehow -- I don't -- I- we don't -- understand what on
Earth they're


 Paul 
That sounds --


 Rainia 
trying to achieve with this but i- it seems like a-


 Paul 
that sounds kind of scary.


 Rainia 
a Christian agenda, yeah, that that -- that, uh, the end of the world,
the end times -- if, um,  <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-11" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> takes over -- <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE> that's h- some --
has something to do with the end times. It's really -- frightening the
way they talk -- and, um,  I don't think he's qualified to be involved
in this at all.  It never was right to begin with n- and,  you know,
we- we're- we're only given certain information and


 Paul 
Mhm.


 Rainia 
hard to really know the whole -- real story of what's going on over
there. But I do know


 Paul 
Right.


 Rainia 
that what the Israelis are doing is wrong.  By going into their
<PLACE country="PS" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-25" type="RGN">territory</PLACE> and building these walls or building settlements -- pushing
the Palestinians out and -- Palestinians -- fight -- with rocks and -- sticks
and -- Israelis have their machine guns and bulldozers and -- I just -- t-
really unpalatable that the -- whole idea, the -- the way they're going
about -- this thing and -- I don't really feel qualified -- to say how it
should be, but -- I -- see it -- being wrong to -- hurt children and -- innocent
people.  No matter what side they're on


 Paul 
Right.
