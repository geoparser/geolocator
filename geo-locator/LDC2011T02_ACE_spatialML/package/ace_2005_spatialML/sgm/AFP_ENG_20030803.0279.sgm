<PLACE country="GQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17934571" id="Pl-1" latLong="3.350°N 8.667°E" state="BN" type="PPLC">MALABO</PLACE>, Aug 3 (AFP)

<PLACE country="GQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17935106" id="Pl-2" latLong="2.000°N 10.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Equatorial Guinea</PLACE>'s President Teodoro Obiang Nguema has provisionally
pardoned 31 men jailed last year for plotting a coup, among them his
chief political opponent, state radio and television said Sunday.

Placido Mico Abogo, 39, secretary general of the main opposition
party, the Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS), was serving two
years and eight months after being sentenced in June 2002 for alleged
complicity in a plot against the president.

He was originally sentenced to 14 years and eight months but the term
was later reduced.

Thirty other prisoners, 18 political opponents and 12 military
officers, also sentenced in June 2002, have also been pardoned.

News of the pardons came on the eve of celebrations marking the 24th
anniversary of Obiang Nguema's seizing of power in the former central
<PLACE continent="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30002777" id="Pl-4" mod="CENTRAL" type="CONTINENT">African</PLACE> <PLACE country="ES" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19596523" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Spanish</PLACE> colony in a coup.

The pardon &quot;is granted to the indicted persons on condition that they
do not again commit the crimes or errors under amnesty for a period
of 10 years,&quot; according to a decree read on official media.

Placido Mico Abogo was found guilty with 67 other defendants,
civilian and military, for taking part in a plot whose existence they
denied.

The two alleged ringleaders, Felipe Ondo Obiang, who held ministerial
office several times and was speaker of the parliament, and former
finance minister Guillermo Nguema Ela, will not benefit from the
amnesty.

They are leaders of the banned Republican Democratic Force (FDR)
opposition party and are serving sentences of 20 and 14 years
respectively.

A further 30 people found guilty were pardoned in October last year
on the occasion of the <PLACE country="GQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17935106" id="Pl-6" latLong="2.000°N 10.000°E" type="COUNTRY">national</PLACE> holiday.

Three others died in <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-60" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> from injuries allegedly received during
their detention and questioning.

The trial of more than 140 people began on May 23, 2002 after the
defendants, who included opposition leaders, a score of military men
and four women, had been rounded up by security forces in March.
Seventy-six were acquitted.

It was held in the disused <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-61" type="FAC">Narsil cinema</PLACE>, where the <PLACE country="GQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17935106" id="Pl-7" latLong="2.000°N 10.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s first
president Francisco Macias Nguema was tried and sentenced to death
after his overthrow by the current head of state, his nephew.

Defence lawyers denounced the trial as being politically motivated
and directly targetting opposition leaders, particularly the heads of
the FDR.

When the trial opened, Ondo Obiang limped into <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-63" type="FAC">court</PLACE> and many of the
accused had visible difficulty raising their right hand for the oath
of truth.

Five defendants who gave evidence at the start of the trial all said
confessions had been extracted from them by torture.

Former UN special rapporteur in <PLACE country="GQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17935106" id="Pl-8" latLong="2.000°N 10.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Guinea</PLACE>, Gustavo Gallon, said in a
report from the <PLACE country="GQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17935106" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.000°N 10.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> that torture was used there as a &quot;normal
means of investigation&quot;.
