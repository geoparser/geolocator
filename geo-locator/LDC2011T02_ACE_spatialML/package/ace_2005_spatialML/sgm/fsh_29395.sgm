6. Criminal Trials/Peterson Scott Peterson has been found guilty of
murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the
death penalty.  There's been a lot of media coverage of the Peterson

What's your name again?

Winnette.  With a ~W.

 Winnette

 Irvin 
~WI -- Okay.  Okay. You're in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780789" id="Pl-2" latLong="44.250°N 85.500°W" state="US-MI" type="CIVIL">Michigan</PLACE>, huh?


 Winnette 
Yeah?


 Irvin 
All right. Uh, what do you know about this Scott -- Peterson trial? I
don't know much about it, to be honest with you.


 Winnette 
Oh this is funny because I just, one of my calls the other day was
regarding this.


 Irvin 
Really?


 Winnette 
So uh uh they're act- -- actually that's getting a few different
questions and -- actually the gentleman I got the other day -- hadn't even
heard about it.  Um,


 Irvin 
Oh really?


 Winnette 
Well um,  I've been following it pretty closely.  Um,  I guess because
of -- you know it being a mother and -- being pregnant for a baby.


 Irvin 
Oh, uh-huh.


 Winnette 
Um,  kind of hit more to -- I you know to home.  Um,  So you -- how much
of it have you followed? Did, did you -- follow any of it at all when it
was on in the news or in the papers or anything?


 Irvin 
Hardly any of it at all, because -- um -- for one thing -- I do not have a
~TV or a radio and I don't get a daily newspaper.  We get


 Winnette 
Oh wow.


 Irvin 
we get a weekly newspaper.


 Winnette 
Okay.  Um,  well I'll I don't get any newspapers at the house, but -- I
listen to the radio every morning on my way to work and


 Irvin 
Oh yeah?


 Winnette 
and uh -- when it first happened it was -- pretty publicized on every
radio station um -- it come across -- on the news and we keep our ~TV on
at my work, because we have a customer waiting area, so


 Irvin 
Oh, uh-huh.


 Winnette 
um actually one of our employees had wa- watched ((happening)) -- so
from that point on we kind of -- talked a lot about it at work and


 Irvin 
How long ago was it?


 Winnette 
different things.  Um,  it was a year -- almost a year ago.  Over a year
ago?  Because it was just before Christmas -- that it happened.


 Irvin 
Over a year ago.


 Winnette 
Yeah.  Um,  I'm thinking -- I don't know, November, December, I'm not
sure exactly.  But I know it was just before Christmas -- when they had
uh -- it had happened, because she was missing during Christmas and then
they had found her body.  And they -- they found the baby as well.


 Irvin 
Terrible.


 Winnette 
Um,  so when they found the baby, the baby of course had been -- they
don't know if the baby was born, through delivery,  or -- if maybe from
um -- the corpse I guess


 Irvin 
So the baby was separate.


 Winnette 
maybe extracted it.  Um, actually she was pregnant for the baby.


 Irvin 
But the baby was separate from the body when he found it?


 Winnette 
Yes.  Yep.  Um,  I don't know if ma- I you know I don't know the whole
story for sure, but -- um -- he had -- you know, obviously -- denied that he
was involved anything to do with it. Then they found out that he was
having an affair on her.  And -- then of course when they were
investigating him -- he tried running.  Dyed his hair and -- grew out a
mustache and -- they caught him trying to run with -- quite a bit of cash.


 Irvin 
Wow.


 Winnette 
So I mean,


 Irvin 
(())


 Winnette 
he's -- in all honesty been guilty all along the way but


 Irvin 
Uh-huh.


 Winnette 
of course you know they've got to give him that reasonable doubt.


 Irvin 
Uh-huh.  So is he is he still um -- in prison now?


 Winnette 
Yeah.  And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will get
the death penalty, or life in prison.  So that's what's is up in the
air right now.


 Irvin 
What state is this in?


 Winnette 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-5" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>.


 Irvin 
It's in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-6" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>.


 Winnette 
And -- um -- I know I had, it was supposed to have be deliberated on -- the
twenty-second of November,  but they had an issue happen with -- one of
the jurors -- so it's postponed everything.  But,  actually they were
trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into
effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for
there to be a double murder charge.


 Irvin 
Oh, uh-huh.


 Winnette 
And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that
charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges.


 Irvin 
Uh-huh.


 Winnette 
And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got
first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby.  So
he didn't get both first degree murders.


 Irvin 
What's the difference?


 Winnette 
Where -- Um,  I guess because he didn't murder the baby directly.


 Irvin 
Oh.


 Winnette 
I'm thinking maybe was the difference.  And because of the the charge
on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty,
but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever


 Irvin 
What was his excuse for doing something horrible like that?


 Winnette 
and -- well he still denies everything.  He has never admitted


 Irvin 
((Still does))


 Winnette 
to do it.  um -- But the only thing they can figure is that maybe -- he
wanted back into the bachelor life, and didn't want to be a father,
didn't want to be tied down with a wife and child


 Irvin 
So he didn't have any other children?


 Winnette 
that was -- No, that was going to be their first.  And actually I don't
even think they were married that long, maybe a year or two.
