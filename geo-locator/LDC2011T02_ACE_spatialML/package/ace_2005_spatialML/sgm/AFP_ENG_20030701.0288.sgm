<PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18002987" id="Pl-6" latLong="9.083°N 7.533°E" state="FC" type="PPLC">ABUJA</PLACE>, July 1 (AFP)

<PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17979109" id="Pl-2" latLong="10.000°N 8.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Nigerian</PLACE> police fired tear gas Tuesday to disperse strikers gathering
outside the government's main administrative offices and assaulted
three journalists covering the protests.

As a general strike called to protest a government decision to
increase fuel prices by 54 percent entered its second day, protesters
gathered in front of the Federal Secretariat building in <PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18002987" id="Pl-7" latLong="9.083°N 7.533°E" state="FC" type="PPLC">Abuja</PLACE>.

A first gathering of a few dozen people was dispersed by a volley of
tear gas from riot police who arrived in 18 jeeps, but when labour
leader Adams Oshiomhole arrived to address the strikers, hundreds of
supporters gathered.

Police again fired tear gas and waded into the crowd, sending the
strikers scattering for cover in the secretariat building itself.

A <PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17979109" id="Pl-3" latLong="10.000°N 8.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Nigerian</PLACE> photographer from the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-11" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>-based agency the Associated
Press (AP), George Osodi, the labour editor of the <PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17979109" id="Pl-4" latLong="10.000°N 8.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Nigerian</PLACE> daily The
Vanguard Funmi Komolafe and Vanguard reporter Rotimi Ajayi were
beaten by police.

The AP photographer's camera was smashed and he was beaten with whips
and rifle butts, leaving him badly bruised.

In the commercial capital <PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17982645" id="Pl-10" latLong="6.453°N 3.396°E" state="LA" type="PPL">Lagos</PLACE>, students were setting up barricades
around their <PLACE continent="AF" country="NG" form="NOM" id="P-14" state="LA" type="FAC">campus</PLACE>, while police played a cat-and-mouse game with
protesters elsewhere in the <PLACE country="NG" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17982645" id="Pl-12" latLong="6.453°N 3.396°E" state="LA" type="PPL">city</PLACE>.

Later Oshiomhole emerged from the secretariat <PLACE continent="AF" country="NG" form="NOM" id="P-15" state="FC" type="FAC">building</PLACE> <SIGNAL id="S-1">in</SIGNAL> <PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18002987" id="Pl-8" latLong="9.083°N 7.533°E" state="FC" type="PPLC">Abuja</PLACE> and
once more addressed supporters, calling on them to show restraint.

&quot;I want to assure you that I'm safe,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no peace in
life without struggle. Every job has its own hazards.

&quot;My plea is that <PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17979109" id="Pl-5" latLong="10.000°N 8.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Nigerian</PLACE> workers should be peaceful, but don't go to
work until these issues are resolved.&quot;

After Oshiomhole drove off, protesters began to disperse quietly and
the police scaled down their presence.

Meanwhile there were conflicting reports that protesters had been
shot dead by security forces on Monday.

Asked by AFP to confirm press and television reports that between two
and eight people had been shot, national police spokesman Chris
Olakpe had initially said: &quot;It was four.&quot; But he later rang back to
deny the reports.

&quot;I have checked our records and found that 88 people were arrested
nationwide, but I have no record of people shot,&quot; he said.

According to the <PLACE country="NG" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:18002985" id="Pl-13" latLong="8.833°N 7.167°E" state="FC" type="CIVIL">state</PLACE>-owned Daily Times eight people were killed in
protests in <PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18002987" id="Pl-9" latLong="9.083°N 7.533°E" state="FC" type="PPLC">Abuja</PLACE> on Monday, the first day of a general strike.
Another daily, The Champion, put the number at two.

Both papers said that security forces, either police or army, had
shot at protesters. An army spokesman told AFP he had no knowledge of
the incident.
