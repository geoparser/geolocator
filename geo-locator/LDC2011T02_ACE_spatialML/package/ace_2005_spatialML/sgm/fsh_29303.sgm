4. Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering
his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death
penalty.  Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he's been convicted
of?  If so, what were his motives?  How closely did you follow the
trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial?
What kind of sentencing should Peterson receive?


 A 
Uh, there there's something about this Scott Peterson trial, though,
that the th- that I can't I can't recall hearing.  Did the -- are they
still going to try to get him with, uh,  the death penalty or are they
-- -- or are they going to be content with just, uh,  just, you know,
giving him life, uh, have heard about that?


 B 
Um,


 A 
I mean, are are they still going to go after him with al- with all
their -- all of their ability?  Eh, you know, are they -- are they s-


 B 
I think if they do -- if they -- th- I think that they can -- because -- in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-1" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>,  uh,  the baby was considered a person


 A 
Yeah, yeah.  So, th- then an-


 B 
and they had a little bit about that at church last week -- when I went
to church services, or the week before, I can't remember, but,  um,
it -- I kind of thought then -- that, uh, when I first heard about the
case,  let me just back up a little bit.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
When I first -- heard the case,  or about it,  I -- told myself,  if he
did do it,


 A 
Yeah, he probably did.


 B 
and I think he did,


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
uh, if he did do it,  I -- thought to myself,  he will probably get -- the
maximum sentence of whatever it is


 A 
Well, he he he probably will, yeah.


 B 
because of the baby


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
and, to me, I -- don't believe even -- eh, exactly, you know, fetal
state,  I believe that that was a baby -- that could've lived.


 A 
Right, a human being, yeah.


 B 
So, to me,  I wouldn't -- he- it wouldn't've been good if he -- if I
had been on his jury.


 A 
Mm, yeah, I see what you mean.


 B 
I could never vote,  I mean, to let him go.


 A 
Well, you know


 B 
I c- but, now, I don't know that I would vote for a death penalty
because I'm not sure that a -- a death cancels out a death.


 A 
Right, yeah.


 B 
I'm not -- -- I I don't know, and -- I wouldn't really be able to vote -- on
that because my father was killed at work.


 A 
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.


 B 
So, you think you -- -- so, you know, I I've got two things that
probably -- I would be disqualified on that kind of a jury.


 A 
Yeah, maybe so.


 B 
Well, I'm pretty sure of it.


 A 
Well, uh-


 B 
But,  uh,  believe it or not, I do still feel sorry for him


 A 
Uh, wh- yeah, I do too. I feel sorry for him.


 B 
because,  uh,


 A 
He's going to be in the


 B 
more so for his family -- m- more so for both families -- because I know
that from my own experience,  we're the one's that are left.


 A 
Well, he's also being, uh, you know, dragged through, uh, the media,
you know, uh,


 B 
Now, to to me that was


 A 
the nation-wi- nation-wide med- the natio-


 B 
totally unfair.


 A 
Oh, you mean being dragged through the media like that? Yeah, it it is
unfair, yeah.


 B 
Yeah.  That was wrong.


 A 
You know, he's having th- he's having th-


 B 
Eh, I I don't know, though, if it was because it was sensational lies.
The case was so different


 A 
W- well it was a-


 B 
and horrible.


 A 
it was a pretty sensational case, all right, yeah.


 B 
And then when they drug in, I re- I can't -- that Amber Frey,  and
then also that, um,


 A 
I'm in th-


 B 
Gloria Allred,


 A 
Yeah, Amber's the attorney.


 B 
any time you bring in Amb- er, I mean, Allred,  I'm not against her,
I like her,  eh, at times, but -- when they brought her in -- and this
other woman,  I though, uh-oh,  any chance he has of any -- of any
kind of a trial that's,  uh,  not what I call sensationalized,  is
over.


 A 
Well, yeah. Uh,I agree with that, yeah.


 B 
Over.  Forge-


 A 
You know, she was, eh, in -- always ruling in, uh, in, uh,  what was
the word I was looking for, uh,  possessive -- no, not possessive but
protective -- of, um,  of, uh, her client, um,  just, um,  wh- what was
her name?


 B 
Amber?  The- the girl?


 A 
Yeah.  He was o- yeah. She was always ready to bite anyone's head off
that ha- had anything,  you know,  slightly wrong abo- you know, uh,
ow,  or amiss about Amber.


 B 
Well, you know, you may think I'm a little -- crazy, but at first when I
heard about,  uh,  Frey,  when I first heard about her,  I got worried
that maybe it was -- both of them


 A 
No, yeah, may-


 B 
because they're -- I've never totally -- believed -- that Peterson did
this all by himself.


 A 
She may have -- she may have, uh, planted the idea in his head, you
know.


 B 
Yet something tells me,  and -- I think -- that he actually -- was so
involved her,  th- Amber,


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
that if -- she had anything to do with this,  I don't think he would
ever tell.  I don't believe he would ever tell on her.


 A 
Yeah.  Uh


 B 
There was the impression I got. I kind of,  uh,  watched him at
different times when they would mention her


 A 
Yeah, he he seemed to be be very vili- he seemed to be most most un-
at- eh, un-at-ease


 B 
and I just think that


 A 
when they were talking about Amber.


 B 
Right.


 A 
Yeah.  Uh


 B 
And that caught my eye. I don't know if it's because I'm a woman but,
um,  I thought, uh-oh,


 A 
Hm.


 B 
because at that time, uh -- right now, I've been, like, totally busy
with,  uh,  holiday,  you know, so


 A 
Yeah.  Yeah.
