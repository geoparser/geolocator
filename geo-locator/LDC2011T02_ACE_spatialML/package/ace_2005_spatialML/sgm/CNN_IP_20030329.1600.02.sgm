It was in northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> today that an eight artillery round hit the site
occupied by <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208909932" id="Pl-11" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> fighters near <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16895613" id="Pl-13" latLong="35.537°N 44.832°E" state="SW" type="PPL">Chamchamal</PLACE>. It happened near an area
abandoned earlier by <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> forces. CNN's Kevin Sites is in northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

This is the <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-19" type="ROAD">road</PLACE> to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892885" id="Pl-17" latLong="35.468°N 44.392°E" state="TS" type="PPLA">Kirkuk</PLACE>. A day ago it was controlled by <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> troops
and packed with these land mines but now we can drive far enough to see
the outskirts of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892885" id="Pl-18" latLong="35.468°N 44.392°E" state="TS" type="PPLA">Kirkuk</PLACE>. That's because coalition fighter jets pummeled
this <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> position on the <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-20" type="MTS">hills</PLACE> above <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16895613" id="Pl-14" latLong="35.537°N 44.832°E" state="SW" type="PPL">Chamchamal</PLACE> and <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> troops made a
hasty retreat. This is what the <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-21" type="MTN">hilltop</PLACE> looks like now, craters 15 feet
deep, busted bunkers and twisted metal, scattered ammunitions and
tattered clothing, a helmet, a tube of toothpaste. <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208909932" id="Pl-12" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> Peshmerga
fighters took their place. I'm glad to see them go this one says. They
killed a lot of our people in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16895613" id="Pl-15" latLong="35.537°N 44.832°E" state="SW" type="PPL">Chamchamal</PLACE> but I feel bad for them too.
Some of them were only conscripts. Some Kurds took advantage of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
retreat right away. This one took a bulldozer to a concrete portrait of
Saddam Hussein. It took about 20 minutes but finally it came toppling
down. He says after finishing the job he hopes Saddam Hussein himself
will fall too but despite the exuberance of Kurds in the area, it's clear
it's much too early to celebrate. Although the Iraqis retreated from this
area, at dusk they fired what observers say were seven artillery rounds
back at their former stronghold creating new fear and potentially new
casualties.

 WOODRUFF 
All right and when we return, waiting here on the home front, a very
special reunion between a Marine and his wife. There is no greater gap
probably than that between the troops overseas and their loved ones here
at home. CNN helped bridge that cassum (ph) at least temporarily between
Sergeant Craig Martin of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and his wife
Kaycee Martin in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-22" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>. They talked by videophone this morning.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR 
You're eight months pregnant I believe. How has this been for you?


 KAYCEE MARTIN, WIFE OF SOLDIER 
It's been difficult. It's hard without him. I'm doing OK but it would be
much better if he was home with me.


 COOPER 
If I could just ask, I mean and you know I don't want to pry so anytime I
ask something you don't want to say just tell me to shut up but what is
it like for you watching all this coverage? I mean watching, you know,
the access. The pictures were seeing are really historic in what we are
able to see. Is it more - does it make it more difficult? Does it make it
easier?


 K. MARTIN 
It's very difficult. It's hard. The whole time though you're just sitting
there trying to catch a glimpse just to see if maybe one of the people on
TV is him but you know he tells me don't watch, don't watch. You know,
it's going to be difficult but like I said, it's just too hard. I want to
be able to see just to make sure that he's OK, just catch a glimpse of
him.


 COOPER 
How does he look to you right now?


 K. MARTIN 
He looks all right, but dirty.


 SGT. CRAIG MARTIN, 15TH MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT 
I lost my tooth.


 K. MARTIN 
Beautiful. Thanks. Thanks for showing me.


 COOPER 
How'd you - how'd you lose your tooth?


 C. MARTIN 
Sorry.


 COOPER 
Can I ask? How did you lose your tooth?


 C. MARTIN 
When we came across the bridge, the enemy launched some 155 artillery
rounds at us. It came pretty close and the concussion knocked my tooth
out.


 K. MARTIN 
Great.


 C. MARTIN 
Yes.


 K. MARTIN 
It doesn't sound like you're being too careful.


 C. MARTIN 
It was fun though. We're all right.


 COOPER 
Sergeant Martin I don't know if you see, your wife's sort of shaking her
head.


 C. MARTIN 
Careful as I can be. It's all good.


 COOPER 
Sergeant Martin, is there anything else ...


 C. MARTIN 
I love you.


 COOPER 
Is there anything else you would like to say either to your wife or to
all the people who are watching this? I know this awkward, you know,
doing this on TV and I hate to put you in this position but feel free.


 C. MARTIN 
Yeah. I've got a couple of things real quick. To my old man, this is not
a distraction. To my wife, we'll be home soon and I love you. That's all
I've got to say.


 COOPER 
Well that says a lot. Kaycee, anything else you want to say?


 K. MARTIN 
I love you very much. I miss you very much. Everyone is praying for you
and I just want you to come home safe and soon so you could see our new
baby.


 C. MARTIN 
One more thing, you look really beautiful right now.


 K. MARTIN 
Thanks. I'd like to say the same to you.


 C. MARTIN 
That's stylish. Don't worry. We'll take it home.


 K. MARTIN 
Well, just come home soon.


 C. MARTIN 
Without a doubt.


 K. MARTIN 
--- Well, just come home soon.


 C. MARTIN 
I'll try baby.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

 WOODRUFF 
A little embarrassing for us to watch. It's got to be difficult talking
to your loved one in front of thousands and thousands of people on
television, millions. Well, in addition to the baby on the way, the
Martins also have a three-year-old daughter. And that is it for this
hour. I'm Judy Woodruff in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-23" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>. Wolf Blitzer's report starts right
now.
