11. Holiday Traditions: The holiday season is right around the
corner. Who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays? Do you go
to a lot of parties with friends, neighbors, co-workers or family
members? Are there people you see during the holidays that you don't see
during the rest of the year? Do you travel to meet up with family or
friends during the holidays? Where do you go and who do you visit?
