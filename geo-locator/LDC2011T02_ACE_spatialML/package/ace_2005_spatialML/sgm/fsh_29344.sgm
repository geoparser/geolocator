5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in
a <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-6" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" predicative="true" state="FR-75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> <PLACE country="FR" form="NOM" id="Pl-75" state="FR-75" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help or
hurt the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>-<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?
What do you think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" state="FR-75" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> policy should be toward <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE> now that Arafat
has died? What, if anything, should the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> do to be involved in the
<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-12" predicative="true" type="RGN">Middle East</PLACE> peace process?


 Ben 
Hello?


 Sue 
Hi, my name is Sue and I'm from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780785" id="Pl-14" latLong="42.000°N 93.500°W" state="US-IA" type="CIVIL">Iowa</PLACE>. How are you doing?


 Ben 
Hi, Sue. I'm Ben, I'm from the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:972944" id="Pl-15" latLong="40.850°N 73.867°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL">Bronx</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-16" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>.


 Sue 
Oh, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208918467" id="Pl-17" type="RGN">east coast</PLACE>.  Very nice.


 Ben 
Yes.  Pouring raining here and cold.


 Sue 
Oh, well, it's -- you should be getting a little bit of a reprieve,
because our is getting a little more mild and -- we seem to get the
little more mild weather right before you do, so


 Ben 
Well, that's good. I w- I want a little.


 Sue 
it's coming.  Yeah, we even, uh, grilled out the last couple of days,
so.


 Ben 
Oh, how nice.


 Sue 
Yeah.


 Ben 
Who's- who's we?


 Sue 
Uh, well, my husband and I. Yeah.


 Ben 
Oh, how nice.  Yeah, I'm single, uh, have a- a boyfriend.


 Sue 
Oh, you do?


 Ben 
Yeah.  Yeah.


 Sue 
Well,  good for you.


 Ben 
And we're talking about Arafat here.


 Sue 
Yes, Arafat. Let's talk about Arafat. What do you think?


 Ben 
Huh.  What do I think?  Um,  well,  when -- around the time he was he
was getting the Nobel Peace Prize and stuff,  I think he got that.


 Sue 
Yes, he did.


 Ben 
Um,  there was a show here in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-18" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> at a big theater. I think maybe
it was at <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-70" state="US-NY" type="FAC">Lincoln Center</PLACE> in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-74" state="US-NY" type="FAC">Philharmonic Theater</PLACE> or the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-71" state="US-NY" type="FAC">Metropolitan Opera House</PLACE> or the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-20" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="CIVIL">New York State</PLACE> <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-72" state="US-NY" type="FAC">Theater</PLACE> or something.
And Arafat came in and got a standing ovation, you know, a peace prize
winner bah bah bah bah bah.  The mayor of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-19" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>, who was then
Rudolph Giuliani,  stood up and walked out, he was also in attendance,
and his, uh, comment to the press afterwards was that, you know, he
just didn't want to honor a terrorist, and I -- one of the few things
that I was happy about with Giuliani when he was mayor.


 Sue 
Mhm.


 Ben 
Uh, Giuliani got very popular later because of the- the


 Sue 
Nine eleven.


 Ben 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-73" state="US-NY" type="FAC">World Trade Center</PLACE> thing but he- he wasn't so popular as a mayor.


 Sue 
Yeah.  Right, I knew that.


 Ben 
But, you know, I- I kind of agreed with that Arafat thing, though.  I
-- but I do think he accomplished something in that the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE>
people do have a legitimate grievance and he put it on the map, you
know.


 Sue 
Well, he- -- he did but I think he really failed miserably,  in my
opinion, when he,  um,  refused to sign that treaty that was
originally set up because it was a wonderful -- option and it really
could've re- done some wonderful things for his people and I think he
really did them a disservice by not taking care of it at that time.


 Ben 
Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, what was the treaty? I'm not familiar with it.


 Sue 
Well, um, where they were going to, uh, give them, like, ninety-six
percent of the Ga- of- of <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-13" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="PS-GZ" type="CIVIL">Gaza</PLACE> and he said that he wanted all hundred
percent.  And so he refused to sign it. It was just an- an incredible
faux pas on his part, from my opinion.


 Ben 
Oh.  Yeah. Yeah, y- it's- it's -- you have to sometimes take a little
bit less than you want, you know, uh,  an- and ninety-six percent is a
big percentage, you know.


 Sue 
Yes. And I think that could have really done some wonderful uh steps
for -- uh for the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> people uh as a whole.  And I felt -- very
sad that, um, that that wasn't -- done. It really should've been. Um, it
was really quite unfortunate that- that he -- that he was not willing
to,  um, step forward -- to do- do what was really in the best interests
of his people.


 Ben 
Sometimes- sometimes I th- I think it's hard when- when you're the-
the first leader, or the George Washington of something, to see things
other than in black and white.  You know, or maybe he didn't have the
gift of- of nuance that would've helped him to- -- to take that right
step, uh, you know, the- -- the -- his people suffer so terribly and
maybe, you know, it could have been better if he had signed that, huh.


 Sue 
I really think so. I really, truly do and now it's a- a situation
where, with his passing, um, I think there's a real, um, new opening,
a new possibility for- -- some extremely positive steps to come forward
out of this -- I do think that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> -- will probably be
requested to be involved in the negotiation process and I understand
that, I me- uh, because,  um, I think -- both sides -- have a trust in the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> that make it-


 Ben 
And we've ha- we have a history, uh, Clinton and Carter w- worked over
there -- -try to get some peace going.  They they they worked very
personally. They had those retreats and things with the leaders,


 Sue 
Right.


 Ben 
arm-twisting sessions.  And stuff, and uh -- That's why we should be
there but I'm I'm kind of scared of the people -- that represent the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> now, you know. They're not quite the same caliber.


 Sue 
Well, that's really true, um,  but it- it is a -- I mean, we are
having a- a -- step forward in a lot of ways, um. We- we, I think, do
have some potentials, um, to do some extremely positive, um, um,
things.
