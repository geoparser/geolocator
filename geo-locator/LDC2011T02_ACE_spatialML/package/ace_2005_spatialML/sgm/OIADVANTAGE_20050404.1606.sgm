From AP (via Yahoo): ChevronTexaco to Buy Unocal in $16.4B Deal

I just have some quick thoughts about this buyout. I generally steer
clear of companies involved in mergers. Merging companies is a complex
process that is fraught with landmines. On top of this, the purchasing
company has numerous incentives to 1. overbid and 2. overestimate cost
savings to justify the overbidding. However, this move by ChevronTexaco
seems to fit that subset of mergers that can avoid the standard
landmines.

1. ChevronTexaco has some great experience to build off of with its
merger with Texaco. Matthew Hayward studied 214 acquisitions by 120
firms between 1990 and 1995 ( 2002 Strategic Management Journal, Vol
23:1 ). He found that acquisition performance is positively related to
previous experience with acquisitions that are 1. not too similar or
dissimilar with the current acquisition, 2. associated with small
losses, and 3. not too temporally close or distant from the current
acquisition. The Texaco merger does not align along all of these
dimensions but the key is that it is temporally close enough that the
institutional knowledge about what does and does not work with a major
merger should still be fresh. It is also temporally far enough removed
from the present that the company will not be overwhelmed with internal
change.

2. The oil and gas industry is driven by future projections about
supply and this merger is all about Unocal's natural gas and oil
properties. Provided ChevronTexaco did not overpay for these assets (an
issue I will leave to those more knowledgable about this industry), the
addition of these increasingly valuable assets should more than makeup
for the inevitable over-optimistic estimates of cost savings from
merging operations.

Previously, I 've made the point that my approach can be viewed as a
&quot;spidey sense&quot; add on to fundamental company analysis. Recall that
Spiderman's spidey sense is the ultimate pessimist's super power. It
warns of impending danger, not impending good fortune. Many of the
variables that I examine seem to work best as red flags that warn of
potential danger hidden within a company. Well, I guess I can say that
my spidey sense is not tingling with this merger as it usually does with
large corporate mergers.
