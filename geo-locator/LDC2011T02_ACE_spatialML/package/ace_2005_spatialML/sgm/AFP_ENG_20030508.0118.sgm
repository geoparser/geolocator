&quot;The combination of the banking operations of Barclays <PLACE country="ES" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19596523" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Spain</PLACE> and
Zaragozano will bring together two complementary businesses, creating
a nationwide distribution platform, trebling the existing Barclays
branch network and trebling its existing customer base,&quot; Barclays
said in a statement.

&quot;The acquisition of Banco Zaragozano builds on our existing business
creating the sixth largest private sector banking group in <PLACE country="ES" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19596523" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Spain</PLACE>&quot; by

&quot;It provides a platform for us to intensify and strengthen our
competitive position in the <PLACE country="ES" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19596523" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Spanish</PLACE> banking market, to the advantage
of our customers, employees and shareholders.&quot;

The members of the board of Zaragozano have voted in favour of the
transaction and have committed to sell their shares to Barclays.

Shareholders, including board members, owning 54 percent of the
ordinary share capital of Zaragozano have given irrevocable
commitments to accept the offer.

The takeover, which is subject to approval by 75.01 percent of
Zaragozano shareholders, is expected to be completed in July.
