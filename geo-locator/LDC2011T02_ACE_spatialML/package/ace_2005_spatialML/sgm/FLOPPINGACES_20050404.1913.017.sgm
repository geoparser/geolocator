The Bias In The MSM

<TEXT>

Great article in the Investors Business Daily today about the bias in
the MSM:

The attention given to any event that shows the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> in a bad light,
and the inattention paid to news that makes <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> mistakes pale by
comparison, never ceases to amaze.

Case in point: word last Thursday that a <PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Canadian</PLACE> photojournalist was
beaten, tortured and raped before dying two years ago while in custody
in <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-7" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>.

This got all of 2 1/2 inches inside both The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-11" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> Times and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328" id="Pl-12" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Los
Angeles</PLACE> Times, and we doubt another word will be heard.

But then, this wasn't a case of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> prisoners at <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16898381" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.301°N 44.209°E" state="BG" type="PPL">Abu Ghraib</PLACE> being
forced by <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> soldiers to wear dog collars or women's underwear. We'll
probably never hear the end of that.

Nor was it a case of a woman journalist -- like Giuliana Sgrena of
the communist newspaper Il Manifesto -- being fired on as her limousine
ran an <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> <PLACE id="Pl-137" type="FAC">checkpoint</PLACE> in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. That prompted an <PLACE country="IT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19880600" id="Pl-17" latLong="42.833°N 12.833°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Italian</PLACE>
outpouring eclipsed only by the death of the pope.

Still, the <PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-5" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Canadian</PLACE> death in <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-8" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE> involved both a prisoner and a
female journalist, and you tell us which was most &quot;horrific.&quot;

The journalist was Zahra Kazemi, 54, a freelancer of <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-9" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iranian</PLACE> origin
who had the guts -- or just the professionalism -- to take photos
outside a <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16912659" id="Pl-18" latLong="35.672°N 51.424°E" state="07" type="PPLC">Tehran</PLACE> <PLACE id="Pl-135" type="FAC">prison</PLACE> during student-led protest against the ruling
theocracy. For this, she was arrested.

Just days later, Kazemi was taken -- unconscious, with bruises all
over her body -- to a military <PLACE id="Pl-136" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE>. Prison officials said she was
suffering digestive problems and had vomited blood.

The hospital doctor who examined her, and who has since won asylum,
told reporters last week in <PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-6" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Canada</PLACE> that the blood Kazemi vomited had
poured down her throat from a smashed nose.

That wasn't all. The doctor, Shahram Azam, noticed injuries to her
entire body that could only have been caused by torture and rape. They
included a skull fracture, two broken fingers, missing fingernails and a
crushed big toe. There were also deep scratches on the neck and evidence
of flogging on the legs and back.

Azam said that as a male doctor in a military hospital, he was barred
from examining a woman's genitals. But he said the nurse who did so told
him of &quot;brutal damage.&quot;

<PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-10" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iranian</PLACE> officials have said Kazemi died after she went on a hunger
strike, fainted and struck her head as she fell. Other authorities at
various times have acknowledged that she was killed by state security
officials. But the official explanation remains unchanged.

Case -- and, no doubt, news coverage -- closed. Now THIS journalist
was assassinated, unlike Sgrena....not only that, she was REALLY
tortured, unlike those poor widdle terrorists in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16898381" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.301°N 44.209°E" state="BG" type="PPL">Abu Ghraib</PLACE> who were
forced to wear womens panties over their heads....gasp!

It's unbelievable the kind of stink the MSM made over the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16898381" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.301°N 44.209°E" state="BG" type="PPL">Abu Ghraib</PLACE>
story but have hardly made a sound over this one.
