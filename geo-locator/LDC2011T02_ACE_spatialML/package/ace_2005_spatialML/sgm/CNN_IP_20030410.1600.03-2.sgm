 WOODRUFF 
Some pictures. Well, Laith Kubba is an <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> exile who has family members
in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. Mr. Kubba is a senior fellow at a think tank called the National
Endowment for Democracy. He is also the president of a group of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
exiles, a group called the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> National Group. He joins us now from
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-30" latLong="51.500Â°N 0.117Â°W" state="GB-ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE> to talk about rebuilding his <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. Mr. Kubba, first of all,
your thoughts as you've watched these scenes of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, the Saddam
Hussein regime falling in the last day?


 LAITH KUBBA, PRESIDENT, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">IRAQI</PLACE> NATIONAL GROUP 
It is a huge sigh of relief, because it could have been much worse and
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> could have been a war theater with more destruction to property.
And, obviously, there are four million people who could have suffered
more. So, there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse. But, obviously,
there is a great, great concern about the scenes that you've been showing
on television.


 WOODRUFF 
Are you talking to family members now in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and around <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>? And, if
you are, how concerned are they about the lawlessness?


 KUBBA 
Well, not in the recent three or four days. There are no phone lines to
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. In other parts of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, I received with great sadness the
killing of one close colleague, Saeed Abu Naji Abhuey (ph) in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-32" latLong="31.992Â°N 44.351Â°E" state="IQ-NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE>. He
was not killed by former members of the Baath Party or the security of
the army, but by just a local organized group. So those signs to me are
worrying. People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the
power vacuum and are testing it. And the more they test, the more I think
they are claiming.


 WOODRUFF 
How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
after this transition period, however long it is, where the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-33" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> is in
charge?


 KUBBA 
Well, one needs to break down this process into various elements. Today,
there should be an authority. And it's very likely that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-34" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and the
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-31" latLong="54.000Â°N 4.000Â°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces are the authority on land. And there ought to be
administration. And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis. But when it
comes to government, I think we really need to map out step by step how
to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections. We need to
involve the U.N. We need to involve all <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> forces in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>,
outside the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. But we need to do it quickly, because every day
passes by with this vacuum, it's going to spell trouble.


 WOODRUFF 
Well, we know, Mr. Kubba, there are several <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> exiles groups competing
for influence. Is one of them going to have an advantage? And,
particularly, I have in mind the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> National Congress that Mr.
Chalabi, who was assisted by <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-35" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces in getting back into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>?


 KUBBA 
I think it's one thing to gain fame and access to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-37" latLong="38.895Â°N 77.037Â°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>. It's
totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.
And I think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-38" latLong="38.895Â°N 77.037Â°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>. It
must really be drawn on the ground inside <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. And there are 22 million
people there. It's not a void. It's not a vacuum. And I think all plans
must be anchored there in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> in its reality.


 WOODRUFF 
So does one group have an advantage over another now?


 KUBBA 
There are different groups who have advantage over others in different
parts of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. Unfortunately, we do not have a national group that
can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice.This needs to be
constructed, maybe through a conference to be held in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, where
representatives from provinces all over <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> need to participate, as well
as political groups. But we do not have a single group, a single
leadership or a single council yet.


 WOODRUFF 
We're talking with Laith Kubba, who is the president of a group of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
exiles. The group is called the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> National Group. Mr. Kubba, we thank
you so much for talking to us from <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-29" latLong="51.500Â°N 0.117Â°W" state="GB-ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE>.


 KUBBA 
Thank you.


 WOODRUFF 
We appreciate it.


 KUBBA 
Thank you.


 WOODRUFF 
Here in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-39" latLong="38.895Â°N 77.037Â°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>, members of the House of Representatives come together
to support <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-36" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE>'s armed forces. Up next: a live report on that
ceremony and the latest efforts to pass a spending bill to pay for the
war.
