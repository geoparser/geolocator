Google News sued

And given that their defense will essentially be &quot;Any publicity is
good publicity,&quot; it's ironic that this lawsuit will get them a lot of
attention. The gist: AFP is suing Google for using their content without
permission . Google argues that since they give everyone a chance to
opt-out, they already have permission (a little weak -- but really, all
Google News does is blogging without the commentary. Or the blogger). No
idea who will win in this case, but it can't harm Google much even if
they lose: The amount at stake is only $18 million.

Whether Google has a lot to lose in this case cannot be measured just
by the damages sought, but by the potential precedent. If the court
determines that scraping and redisplaying portions of copyrighted
material is not a &quot;fair use&quot; under <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> copyright laws, then it seems to
me Google has a very big issue to contend with.
