Can you freakin believe this ? (hat tip The Jawa Report ):

A terrorist group has published a do-it-yourself plan to make a dirty
bomb on its Internet site. Named Alma'sadah Al-Jihadiah, the site is run
by a group whose aim is to promote and propagate terror activities in
the region. A member of the group, calling himself Abu Al-Harith
Al-Sawahiri the Mujahid Sheikh, provides a step-by-step instruction of
making a dirty bomb, starting from tear gas canisters to higher-grade
bombs, including those using uranium, on the site. The member, whose
expertise veers toward chemical warfare, shows a marked emphasis in
making gas bombs. He introduces the subject by naming the different
gases used for these purposes, and follows it up with their reaction
with the elements, effects and their impact, before concluding by
telling all where to buy them.

...

At the end of his session, the writer, who asked his followers to go
for jihad, received a comment from another writer asking him to give
more details as they needed it to start making those gases in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. &quot;We
need simple quick ways to make them, for us to quickly fight the
Americans and the great traitor Allawi,&quot; said the comment. The site has
also issued a statement in the form of a &quot;Fatwa&quot; allowing and justifying
the killing of foreigners in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. The statement entitled
&quot;Fighting the Foreigners&quot;, which is issued by a group based in <PLACE country="DZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20336619" id="Pl-7" latLong="28.000°N 3.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Algeria</PLACE>
and named Al-Jama'ah Al-Salafiyah (The Salafi Group), says that the
Crusaders who invaded Islamic countries centuries ago have set up the
Arab governments to be their eyes in the region. Therefore, the group
argues, it is a must to kill the foreigners who are guarded by such
governments. Internet Haganah has some more information plus some
screenshots of the post:

Getting back to the moron who posted the nuclear info, username
ahmed_assalafil, we note that he posts using roman, not arabic, letters
in a weird mix of Arabic and English. Elsewhere he explains that this is
because he is a Palestinian in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">USA</PLACE>, using a computer in a public
<PLACE id="Pl-99" type="FAC">library</PLACE>. He has asked for someone to translate the nuclear 'how-to' info
into Arabic, and claims to have important information about efforts of
al mukhabrat al amrikiah , the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> secret police, to root out and
destroy the jihadis in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>. I'm posting that entire
message here. Make of it what you will. This guy must be hunted down
like prey.
