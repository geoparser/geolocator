Welcome all to my new site. I've decided to incorporate my old work
blog into a general blog, the work diary is up on the right titled &quot;my
work diary&quot;.

EFF YEAH! BUSH WON!

OK then. My next thought.

The world is a much better place now that the terrorist Yassar Arafat
is dead. Here is a good one minute video on his great legacy Here . This
guy was one of the early innovators of terrorism in this century and he
is protrayed by the Main Stream Media (MSM for short) as a &quot;freedom
fighter&quot;. Because of him millions of palestinians chose &quot;jihad&quot; over
peace with <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-1" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Isreal</PLACE>. He innovated suicide bombers and plane hijacking plus
he embezzelled hundreds of millions of dollars from aid funds....and
this guy got a nobel peace prize, what a disgrace.

UPDATE 1 - Drudge is reporting that Arafat has been skimming 2
million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories

-- Last year auditors discovered Arafat was guilty of skimming $2
million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories, TIME
reports.In August 2002 international donors forced Arafat to sign over
his investments to the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE> Investment Fund, which was audited by
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> accountants and managed by <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> Finance Minister Salam
Fayyad, a former International Monetary Fund official.

After scouring corporations throughout the Arab world and bank
accounts in the <PLACE comment="it's an island with a country code" country="KY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18812595" id="Pl-15" latLong="19.500°N 80.667°W" type="COUNTRY">Cayman Islands</PLACE> and <PLACE country="LU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18263805" id="Pl-16" latLong="49.750°N 6.167°E" type="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</PLACE>, the auditors identified
$800 million, which has been made a part of the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> Authority's
official budget. It's the most successful financial reform in the Arab
world, -- Jim Prince, president of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328" id="Pl-17" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Los Angeles</PLACE>-based Democracy Council
and head of the audit team, tells TIME.

People close to Fayyad's investigation told TIME of Arafat's skimming
from the gas trade. Breaking the gasoline smuggling and corruption
boosted the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> Authority's official treasury by $10 million a
month and cut gas prices for ordinary Palestinians.&quot;Arafat's death means
his followers may never know just how much more they may be owed,
&quot;writes TIME's Matt Rees in &quot;Where's Arafat's Money?&quot;

In the mid-1990s, Arafat controlled a financial empire worth at least
$3 billion. By the time of his death, he was down to his last $1
billion, according to <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-2" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>-intelligence estimates.Arafat wife Suha's
outburst that his successors were &quot;trying to bury [him] alive&quot; came
after she learned that Arafat had signed over at least $800 million to
the government of the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> Authority two years ago, TIME reports.

Top <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> officials say Suha wants the new chief of the P.L.O.,
Mahmoud Abbas, and <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> prime minister Ahmed Qurei to give her
money out of the P.L.O.'s party coffers. But a senior P.L.O. official
tells TIME, &quot;they'll pay her a pension, and that's it.&quot; People familiar
with Arafat's finances say the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> leader sent Suha $200,000 a
month out of the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> Authority's budget for the Office of the
President.

French authorities are investigating transfers of $15 million from

Paribas Bank, a <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-20" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">French</PLACE> bank, TIME reports.Senior <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674628" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> security
officials tell TIME that Arafat also shipped money to the gunmen of the
Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.

Developing... Sure sounds like a Nobel Prize winner to me.
