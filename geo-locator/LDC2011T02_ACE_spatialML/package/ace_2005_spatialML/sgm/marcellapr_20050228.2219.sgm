 Sock Painting Party 

Howdy PR,

We are going to be having a sock painting party at my house instead of
the normal meeting at St. Mary's. It is going to be Wednesday from 5
till 10. Come and go as you need to. We need lots and lots of help
because there are tons of socks to do. We have already made one pair
and they look awesome! Everyone from the campaign in invited! If you
can please bring... junky clothes (wear shorts), scissors, blowdryers,
duck tape and plastic bags. The directions to my house are...

- Start on <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-1" type="ROAD">Texas Ave.</PLACE> and head away from <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-2" type="ROAD">Bryan</PLACE>
- Go down <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-3" type="ROAD">Texas Ave.</PLACE> until you come to <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-4" type="ROAD">South West Parkway</PLACE>
- Take right on <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-5" type="ROAD">SW Parkway</PLACE>
