 CARLSON 
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-3" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>, <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> and <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-5" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Germany</PLACE> today restated
their opposition to any new U.N. Security Council that could threaten
Saddam Hussein's grip on power. Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to
the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can. We're talking with potential war in
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> with Congressman Charlie Rangel, a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-6" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="CIVIL">New York</PLACE> Democrat and his fellow
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-7" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="CIVIL">New Yorker</PLACE> Republican Congressman Peter King.


 BEGALA 
Mr. King, thanks for stying with us through the break. One of the reasons
that we like having you on, and as well as Mr. Rangel, is that, you know,
this is war, as we were saying in the last segment. You treat it with the
gravity and the seriousness that it deserves. And you're a congressman
who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan
interests. So I wonder if you'll join Charlie Rangel, who put out a press
release today, decrying the Republican attempt to hijack a bill to help
our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to
corporations. Isn't that wrong in a time of war?


 KING 
The important thing is that the bill pass for the military. If the other
stuff's in there, it's there. I mean to me, the main purpose should be
the military. I'm not going to disagree with Charlie's point. On the
other hand, often when bills are passed, there are things attached to
them. So to me, the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of the
military and that's what we should do.


 CARLSON 
Congressman Rangel, a couple of months ago Senator Daschle on CBS said --
made the charge that we are, quote, &quot;we haven't made any real progress in
the war against al Qaeda.&quot; A lot of Democrats said similar things. This
weekend Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the No. 2 member of al Qaeda and another
significant al Qaeda member were captured in <PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17227415" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.600°N 73.067°E" state="US-PB" type="PPL">Rawalpindi</PLACE>, <PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17229029" id="Pl-9" latLong="30.000°N 70.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Pakistan</PLACE>.
Doesn't it turn out that Mr. Daschle and others didn't know what they
were talking about and maybe they shouldn't make charges like that in
public when they don't know what they were talking about? You would agree
with that, wouldn't you?


 RANGEL 
If they don't have the pencil that's keeping score, they ought to keep
their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor, every drug
dealer I busted was the most important drug dealer in the world. You just
pass out numbers on whoever you arrest. Why was he No. 3? Why wasn't he
No. 4?


 CARLSON 
Well, I don't know. Because he helped plan the attack on the <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-19" type="FAC">World Trade
Center</PLACE> and the <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-20" type="FAC">Pentagon</PLACE>? I think that puts you pretty high up in the
organization.

(CROSSTALK)

 RANGEL 
Let me tell you, when you arrest somebody, you describe who you're
arresting. I haven't the slightest clue who this guy was.


 CARLSON 
I haven't heard anybody suggest that he's not one of the central figures
in al Qaeda. Have you?


 RANGEL 
Listen, we should be arresting a lot of people. But I think the main
thing that we have now is we should concentrate on Osama bin Laden, we
should concentrate on dismantling Saddam Hussein. We should do all of
those things, but the most important thing is we should not have the
arrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE>
without the...


 CARLSON 
A defenseless <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE>? They have biological weapons. How are they
defenseless?


 BEGALA 
And how'd they get them?


 RANGEL 
Listen, if this is...


 CARLSON 
It was our fault that they have biological and chemical weapons? Come on.


 RANGEL 
Let me tell you. They have it and we supported them having it when they
were fighting <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-13" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE> so it's no big deal there. And the thing is that if we
can disarm them without actually going there, killing them, I really
think that we maintain our moral authority around the world. We have a
lot of people...

(APPLAUSE)

 RANGEL 
... that have dangerous weapons. I mean, what happens if <PLACE country="IN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17902205" id="Pl-14" latLong="20.000°N 77.000°E" type="COUNTRY">India</PLACE> decides
that they could have a preemptive strike against <PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17229029" id="Pl-15" latLong="30.000°N 70.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Pakistan</PLACE>? What happens
if the North Koreans take another look? Our <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> is great enough and
strong enough to maintain the moral authority to convince the
international community that we're right. I don't think we have to kill
to prove that.


 BEGALA 
I'm sorry to have to do this, but we are out of time. I want have
Congressman Peter King from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-8" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" state="US-NY" type="CIVIL">New York</PLACE> back on, and Congressman Charlie
Rangel. Thank you both for a very interesting debate. One of the most
admired men in the world is doing everything he can to avert the horror
of war. In a minute we will look at His Holiness, John Paul II's efforts
to be a peacemaker. Later, the author of &quot;Vanity Fair's&quot; scary new look
at the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. You will not want to miss this. Stay
with us.
