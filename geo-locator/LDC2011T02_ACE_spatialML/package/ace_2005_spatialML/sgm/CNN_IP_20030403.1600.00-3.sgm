Back now to the battlefront and to the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">southern</PLACE> city

could have gone either way today. Armed coalition soldiers moving toward
a venerated <PLACE id="Pl-240" type="FAC">mosque</PLACE> at the request of a Muslim cleric, but angry locals
who didn't understand what they were trying to do. CNN's Ryan Chilcote is
in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-18" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE> with the 101st Airborne.

A tip leads the Bastogne Brigade's No Slack Batallion to this parking <PLACE id="Pl-225" type="FAC">lot</PLACE>

turns up nothing. The only resistance comes from a Volvo. The Shia
population seems curious and friendly but they don't get too close. This
man agrees to be interviewed as long as his face isn't shown. The <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
government, he says, has satellite TV. Anybody could be an informer and
punish us for talking to you, even my family, he tells me in Arabic. The
troops also keep their distance.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Yes, it's very uneasy out here. Don't know who's who.

Sergeant Rod Sutton from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:449508" id="Pl-22" latLong="40.000°N 86.250°W" state="IN" type="CIVIL">Indiana</PLACE> on the <PLACE id="Pl-226" type="FAC">corner</PLACE> of a <PLACE id="Pl-245" type="FAC">street</PLACE> leading to the
highly sensitive <PLACE id="Pl-227" type="FAC">Imam Ali Shrine</PLACE>, one of the holiest <PLACE id="Pl-223" type="FAC">sites</PLACE> in the world
for Shia Muslims. Does it make you nervous that you're so close to the
<PLACE id="Pl-229" type="FAC">Ali mosque</PLACE>? Do you feel like you're tramping on.


 SGT. ROD SUTTON, BASTOGNE BRIGADE 
Holy ground?


 CHILCOTE 
Yes.


 SUTTON 
To some extent, I feel fortunate that I'm here, because this is something
I never would have seen before. And now that I see it I kind of
understand some of the history behind it. So, it makes me more
appreciative of it. To the same extent, I don't want to be invasive with
these people here. I don't want to trample on their holy ground, and I
want to respect that as much as I can.


 CHILCOTE 
Word comes from the grand Ayatollah Sistani that he's willing to meet the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> commander, but he asks first for soldiers to secure his
<PLACE id="Pl-241" type="FAC">compound</PLACE>, located <SIGNAL id="S-1">halfway down</SIGNAL> the <PLACE id="Pl-242" type="FAC">road</PLACE> to the <PLACE id="Pl-235" type="FAC">mosque</PLACE>. No one explains
that to the crowd. (on camera): There is no more striking example of the
sensitivities that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> soldiers face here than what is taking place
on the <PLACE id="Pl-243" type="FAC">streets</PLACE> right up from the <PLACE id="Pl-236" type="FAC">ah Ali mosque</PLACE> right now. (voice-over):
Chaos as the crowd apparently believes the soldiers want to approach the
<PLACE id="Pl-237" type="FAC">shrine</PLACE>.



 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
They want to get inside the holy <PLACE id="Pl-238" type="FAC">shrine of Imam Ali</PLACE>.


 CHILCOTE 
Clerics appear with a message from the grand Ayatollah, but the message
is did drowned out. The colonel instructs his men to stay calm.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
They got to understand, he wants us here. Smile, relax.


 CHILCOTE 
His soldiers take a knee, their weapons brought down from the ready
position. They do everything soldiers can to appear less hostile. But the
potential for confrontation remains. The commander makes the decision.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Turn around, just turn around and go.


 CHILCOTE 
He orders his men back to their <PLACE id="Pl-244" type="FAC">compound</PLACE> to await cooler heads. Ryan
Chilcote, CNN with the 101st Airborne in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-20" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE>, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

And CNN's Nic Robertson telling us earlier, significant that the Shia
Muslim Ayatollahs, what they did, that they were cooperating with
coalition and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops, saying that that will send an important signal
to Shia Muslims throughout the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. Well, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> officials are
investigating two possible friendly fire incidents in which coalition
forces may have mistakenly shot at allied aircraft. In one of the
incidents, a soldier was killed and several others wounded. Before word
of that death, 40 Americans had been killed by hostile fire in Operation
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> Freedom. Eleven of them by friendly fire or in other accidents.
Most of the 27 <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-23" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> troops killed have been victims of friendly fire
or accidents. Meantime, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> says that 420 civilians, they say, have been
killed during the war. And they say 4,000 injured. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> officials say
more than 4,000 Iraqis have been captured. Seven Americans we know remain
prisoners of war in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. Fifteen others are said to be still missing in
action. Well, when they do finally enter <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and coalition
troops could face urban combat with the Republican Guard, some of whom
may have withdrawn into the <PLACE country="GB" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>. But the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> military is expecting to
remain focused on specific <PLACE continent="AI" country="IQ" form="NOM" id="P-248" state="BG" type="FAC">targets</PLACE> in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>.
