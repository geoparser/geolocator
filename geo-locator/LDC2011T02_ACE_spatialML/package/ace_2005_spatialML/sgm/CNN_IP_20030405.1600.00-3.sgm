powerful symbolic message. Soldiers are here to tear down the regime and
all it stands for. By the time they leave <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, they're determined Saddam
and his Ba'ath Party will have bitten the dust. The approach can seem
frustratingly slow, but day by day, the Desert Rats are exerting more
control. Checkpoints meant to filter out <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> hardliners. (on camera):
They're well within striking distance of the mortars and rockets of the
Fedayeen militia, but they're prepared to take that risk to try and
persuade the people of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-10" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="IQ-BA" type="PPLA">Basra</PLACE> that they won't desert them, that they'll
stick with this however messy it gets. (voice-over): Drastic action is
need to convince a dubious population.

Get down, get down!


 BREMNER 
We watched a nighttime raid on the homes of Ba'ath Party officials and
Fedayeen militia. These are men singled out by locals and believed by
army intelligence to be behind much of the brutality and corruption. Most
are not accused of specific crimes but suspected of being part of the
state-sponsored climate of fear.

(UNINTELLIGIBLE), get up!

The party's influence extends to every corner of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> society. In two
small communities, we witnessed more than 70 people being rounded up.
Some are clearly terrified of what lies ahead, uncertain of their fate,
overcome by nerves. But as it ended, there was no <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-14" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> apology for the
scale of the operation.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
We came in firm, we came in fair. There was no shots fired. We gave a
good warning before we came in. We've been playing warnings to people to
stay in their houses, and we've only lifted those people we've got very
good intelligence on.


 BREMNER 
This is not a tactic that can be regularly repeated, or the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-15" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> risk
being accused of installing their own rule of terror. Despite the
discomfort of a few, there's a conviction that this is a night's work
that will benefit the majority. Juliet Bremner in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-11" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="IQ-BA" type="PPLA">Basra</PLACE>.

Well, there has been a terrible discovery by some other <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-16" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> troops in
