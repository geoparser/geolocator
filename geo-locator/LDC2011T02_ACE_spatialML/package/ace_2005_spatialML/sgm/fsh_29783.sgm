 Joe 
Oh, well, there- there're been people that have been -- I don't know
if you've been watching Sixty Minutes, there was a story of this lady
that was -- her -- -- she's a, um,  uh, what do you call it, um,  uh,
reservist


 Tom 
Uh-huh.


 Joe 
and she did her time back in the sixties and she's like fifty
something years old now. And they're going to call her to go.


 Tom 
You got to be -- -- huh.  My goodness.


 Joe 
Yeah.  Yeah, they don't -- they don't have, um -- see what happened
with the, um,  the volunteer army,  they're not getting enough people,
so they're thinking of maybe get- putting in a draft.


 Tom 
Ah.  Eh, she was ar- she was already -- in the service -- and they're
calling her back in?


 Joe 
Was in the service, she- -- yep, she did her time. She thought -- she's

Oh, yeah.


 Joe 
but she did her time.


 Tom 
Oh, oh, she's still in the service.


 Joe

Okay.


 Joe 
So they might- she -- -- this is what the story was about -- and there're
some people that don't want to go.


 Tom 
Yeah.


 Joe 
You know,  so,  but it's- it's kind of a scary thing and I don't know
if the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> is doing the right thing. I don't know, to tell
you the truth.


 Tom 
I -- don't think so.


 Joe 
I- I kind of lean-


 Tom 
Uh, I think- -- I think Bush -- is, uh,  trying to -- -- you know, his his
dad -- pulled everybody out when they just,  uh, kicked -- people out of,
uh,


 Joe 
<PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-24" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>.

 Joe 
Yep.


 Tom 
Okay, he wants to make sure everything's done over there before he
comes back.


 Joe 
Yeah, he wants to finish the job that his father


 Tom 
That's what I think.


 Joe 
started, pretty much.  That's why his father didn't want to invade
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, because of all these problems they're having now.  He knew that
there was going to be -- look at all these insurgents. Look at what
happened a couple days ago, they killed, um,  like seventy people.
They -- put a bomb right into where the -- the, uh,


 Tom 
Oh, man. Well

 Joe 
Yeah.


 Tom

um, Run- Rumsfeld's regigna- resignation and, uh,  even John McCain,
he's a Republican, he wants him -- -- he wants Rumsfeld to get out of
