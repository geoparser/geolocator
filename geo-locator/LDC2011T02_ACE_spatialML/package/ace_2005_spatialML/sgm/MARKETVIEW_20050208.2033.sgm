Cisco's Indication

Today's performance said a lot about how the market viewed certain
subjects; tomorrow's will tell us even more. Today, Ask Jeeves made
their official announcement about acquiring Bloglines. And tonight,
Cisco reported solid earnings and weak sales . The market's modestly
pessimistic reaction to the Bloglines news tells us that blogging isn't
seen as a major profit source yet; tomorrow's trading will tell us
whether the market is ready to accept that more established technology
businesses are back on track as well. After hours, Cisco's been slammed,
but once they're exposed to the rest of the trading population, the
results might differ.

I don't think bloglines will ever be a major source of profits or
revenues. Blogging itself could become a pretty big consumer past time
like watching TV, reading a book, or playing video games but I am not
sure how bloglines really benefits. I would guess it most benefits the
search engines, hit counters, and software builders.

With the explosion in available market commentary that happened
through the internet it is not clear to me that by lowering the costs of
access blogging really adds that much as much as it did to political
commentary. Maybe Seeking Alpha can become the new TSCM but I don't
think that will change the landscape as much as Howard Dean's campaign
did.
