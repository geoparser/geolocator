UNITED NATIONS (AP)

<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-30" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE> on Tuesday proposed immediately suspending U.N. sanctions
targeting <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> civilians, an important step toward the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> goal of
ending trade embargoes that have crippled the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-38" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s economy.

The surprise move by <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-31" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>, which led opposition to the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> war
against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, followed last week's call by <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> President George W.
Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly, so <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> can trade freely and
its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction.

<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-32" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>'s U.N. ambassador, Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, made the proposal
at a Security Council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief
U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchanged
views on potentially divisive postwar issues.

The proposal would end the U.N. ban on trade and investment in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
while leaving a 12-year-old arms embargo in place.

The Security Council imposed sanctions after <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s 1990 invasion of
<PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-39" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>. Under council resolutions, sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons have been destroyed along with the long-range missiles to
deliver them.

Along with <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-33" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>, <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-42" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE>, <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-40" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Germany</PLACE> and <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-41" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE> also strongly opposed
the war. But de La Sabliere said before the meeting that Security
Council ``must take into account the new realities on the ground.''

<PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-43" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> Ambassador Sergey Lavrov had said his <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-44" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> is ``not at all
opposed to the lifting of sanctions.'' But he said <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-45" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> wants U.N.
inspectors to certify that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> has been disarmed of all weapons of
mass destruction, as required under U.N. resolutions.

Asked about the <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-36" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">French</PLACE> proposal, he said: ``We are ready to discuss
it.''

At another closed-door council meeting later Tuesday, the council was
to hear from Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. oil-for-food program,
which had been providing food for 60 percent of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s 24 million
people.

<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-34" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>'s de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council phase
out the oil-for-food program, which allowed <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> to sell unlimited
quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and
compensation to victims of the first <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493586" id="Pl-46" latLong="27.000°N 51.000°E" type="WATER">Gulf</PLACE> War.

``There should be some adjustment with a view of a phasing out of
this program,'' de La Sabliere said.

This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the
weeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

These include not only <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s disarmament and the future of sanctions
but the U.N. role in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> now that the fighting is over, control of
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s oil revenue, and lucrative reconstruction contracts.

Blix stressed that council resolutions call for U.N. inspectors to
have access to all sites and people in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. He said he told the
council that he believes the world would like <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s disarmament
confirmed by an international body that has been involved in the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-37" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> for over 10 years.

The Bush administration, which accused Blix of hindering its drive
for international support for the war, has already sent its own teams
to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> to search for illegal weapons.

``At the moment, the coalition has assumed the responsibilities for
disarming <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>,'' <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Ambassador John Negroponte, said Tuesday when
asked whether <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> teams would work with U.N. inspectors.

He said important scientists had turned themselves in, and the
atmosphere had changed which should enable any Iraqi ``to speak more
freely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are asking
them the questions.''

<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-35" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>'s de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council ``find
practical and pragmatic arrangements'' to coordinate and combine the
work of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> teams and the work of U.N. inspectors ``so that
the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-47" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> disarmament could be internationally verified.''

He told The Associated Press he envisioned sanctions being suspended
``for a couple of months,'' and possibly renewed. He also envisioned
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and U.N. inspectors working together. ``And then sanctions could
be lifted when a legitimate <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-48" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> government is in place,'' he said.

In an interview with BBC radio aired Tuesday, Blix said that before
the war, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-54" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Britain</PLACE> appeared to have used ``shaky''
intelligence, including forged documents, in an effort to prove <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-49" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
had banned weapons.

Blix said it was ``very, very disturbing'' that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> intelligence
failed to identify as fakes documents suggesting <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-50" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> tried to buy
uranium from the West <PLACE continent="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30002777" id="Pl-56" mod="W" type="CONTINENT">African</PLACE> nation of <PLACE country="NE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18915034" id="Pl-55" latLong="16.000°N 8.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Niger</PLACE>. He told reporters at
the United Nations on Tuesday that the contract about ``yellow cake''
uranium ``was more than shaky, it was a fake.''

U.N. inspectors went back to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-51" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> for the first time in four years in
late November and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3{
months of searching. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered all U.N.
international staff, including the inspectors, to leave <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-52" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> just
before the war began on March 20. He has said he expects them to
return.

Annan also said Tuesday in <PLACE continent="EU" country="AT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18025553" id="P-57" latLong="47.3333333 13.3333333" type="COUNTRY">Austria</PLACE> that Iraqis should be in charge of
their own future and natural resources. He acknowledged that ``the
U.N. is being challenged'' but said he expected an agreement on the
U.N. role in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-53" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> in the ``not too distant future.''
