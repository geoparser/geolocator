<PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-3" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Malaysia</PLACE>'s second highest court on Friday rejected an appeal by
jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim against his
conviction and nine-year prison sentence for sodomy.

A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a
verdict by High Court Judge Arifin Jaka nearly three years ago that
found Anwar guilty of sodomizing his wife's former driver. Sodomy is
a crime in this predominantly Muslim Southeast <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-10" mod="SE" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">Asian</PLACE> <PLACE country="MY" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-7" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.

Anwar is expected to appeal again with the Federal Court, <PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-4" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Malaysia</PLACE>'s
highest court.

Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Anwar lambasted the judges,
saying they had been ``preselected'' by the government to quash his
appeal.

``These are spineless judges,'' Anwar said. ``This decision is all
scripted.''

The judges also rejected an application by Anwar to be released on
bail. But Anwar's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for
bail pending a further appeal.

On Monday, Anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on
corruption charges, after the six-year sentence was reduced by
one-third for good behavior. He then began serving the nine-year
prison sentence for sodomy, his lawyers said.

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, his former protege, in
1998 following disputes over financial policy. Anwar led large
protests against Mahathir before he was arrested, charged and
convicted on corruption and sodomy charges.

Anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging
Mahathir for power. The government denies this.

Human rights group Amnesty International said Friday's verdict
``represents another step in the further deterioration in the human
rights situation in the <PLACE country="MY" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.''

``This decision adds to the already widespread perception that in
politically sensitive cases, the independence of the judiciary can no
longer be guaranteed,'' the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-11" latLong="51.500°N 0.117°W" predicative="true" state="GB-ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE>-based group said in a statement.
``Today, the situation looks much bleaker.''

Param Cumaraswamy, the U.N. special investigator on the freedom of
judges and lawyers, said in a statement: ``So long as there are
judges who are prepared to and continue to compromise the value and
principles of their high office ... there is no hope for judicial
independence and impartiality in the <PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-5" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Malaysian</PLACE> justice system.''

About 200 demonstrators outside the <PLACE country="MY" form="NOM" id="Pl-17" type="FAC">court</PLACE> shouted Anwar's slogan of
``Reformasi!'' for political change. Police armed with automatic
weapons stood by to prevent rowdiness.

The court also dismissed a joint appeal by Anwar's adopted brother,
Sukma Darmawan, who was convicted together with Anwar for sodomy in
August 2000 and sentenced to six years in jail and whipping.

Sukma has been free on bail pending appeal, but the judges on Friday
ordered him to begin his sentence.
