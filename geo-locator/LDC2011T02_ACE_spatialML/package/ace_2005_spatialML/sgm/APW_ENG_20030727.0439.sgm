A <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> congressional delegation toured the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> military prison for
terror suspects at <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-8" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER">Guantanamo Bay</PLACE> where they were briefed on
interrogation techniques, a congressman said Sunday.

The visit Saturday came a week after a group of detainees were sent
back to <PLACE country="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16632074" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000°N 65.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</PLACE> and at least one of the men told reporters and
aid workers he was beaten during interrogations at the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> base in
<PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18380782" id="Pl-15" latLong="21.500°N 80.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Cuba</PLACE>.

Military officials in <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-9" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER">Guantanamo</PLACE> have denied the claims.

``They went to great lengths to show us the how they (interrogations)
were handled,'' said Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-20" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="MD" type="CIVIL">Maryland</PLACE>
Democrat, by telephone after returning to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-22" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208940332" id="Pl-23" latLong="38.917°N 77.001°W" state="DC" type="CIVIL">D.C.</PLACE>

Ruppersberger, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence, said he saw interrogation rooms and was briefed on
questioning techniques, but was not present for any interrogations.

He declined to detail techniques or describe the rooms.

The other members in the delegation were Reps. Christopher Smith, a
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-24" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="NJ" type="CIVIL">New Jersey</PLACE> Republican; Benjamin Cardin, a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-21" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="MD" type="CIVIL">Maryland</PLACE> Democrat; Rick
Renzi, an <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-25" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">Arizona</PLACE> Republican; Jo Ann Davis, a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-26" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> Republican;
and Janice Schakowsky, an <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-27" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="IL" type="CIVIL">Illinois</PLACE> Democrat.

Besides visiting the seaside prison camp where the 660 detainees are
being held, the delegation also spoke to troops.

Under increasing pressure at home and abroad to either try or release
the detainees, preparations are underway to hold military tribunals
on <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-10" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER">Guantanamo</PLACE>, where a makeshift courtroom has already been
furnished.

The prison's location in remote eastern <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18380782" id="Pl-16" latLong="21.500°N 80.000°W" mod="E" type="COUNTRY">Cuba</PLACE> puts the detainees out
of the jurisdiction of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> courts, an arrangement that has been
criticized by lawyers and human rights groups.

Human rights groups have also criticized the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> for
interrogating the detainees without allowing them access to
attorneys. Some of the information could be used as evidence in
tribunals.

At least one detainee released last week in <PLACE country="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16632074" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 65.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</PLACE> said he was
tortured and beaten, saying that during his 20 months at the base,
his legs and back were beaten with a metal rod. Another released
detainee said treatment of the prisoners violated the <PLACE country="CH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17447849" id="Pl-28" latLong="46.200°N 6.167°E" state="GE" type="PPLA">Geneva</PLACE>
Conventions.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> military officials at <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-11" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER">Guantanamo</PLACE> have denied the claims and have
said they abide by many tenets of the <PLACE country="CH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17447849" id="Pl-29" latLong="46.200°N 6.167°E" state="GE" type="PPLA">Geneva</PLACE> Conventions.

Detainees come from 42 countries and are held on suspicion of links
to the al-Qaida terrorist network or <PLACE country="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16632074" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000°N 65.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</PLACE>'s ousted Taliban
regime.
