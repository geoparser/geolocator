3. Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term
in office, and he has already started to appoint new people to his
political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John
Ashcroft resign.  Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet
next term?  Who are they, and why do you think they should be
appointed? If you were president, which national figures would you
appoint to your cabinet and why?  What new cabinet positions would you
create and who would fill them?

 Ron 
Yeah me too. Well, jeez, that'll be something to look forward to. I
I'd love to get someone from outside the ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" nonLocUse="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>.


 Sherri 
Mm.  Yeah.


 Ron 
So uh what do you think about the uh topic of discussion this evening?


 Sherri 
I've been sort of surprised. Eh uh I -- I heard uh that Colin Powell
wanted um -- to resign last year and they talked him out of it.


 Ron 
Uh-huh, uh-huh.


 Sherri 
Or something like that and uh so -- I was still surprised this year when


 Ron 
Oh thi- you were surprised that he yo- that he decided to step down.


 Sherri 
yeah I I I still was uh -- kind of surprised.


 Ron 
Oh, huh, how interesting.


 Sherri 
eh -- And uh -- and then uh with Condoleezza Rice. They're appointing her
ta- to a new position, and I was surprised about Ashcroft.


 Ron 
Uh-huh, uh-huh.


 Sherri 
I wasn't like it and then Tom Ridge yesterday.


 Ron 
Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, I I uh that one I think one probably was the
one that most surprised me. I hadn't I hadn't really thought about it.
I -- Colin Powell didn't surprise me. Ashcroft surprised me a little bit
um but um I sort of started to think he might step down because
evidently he was being he was considered somewhat of a lightning rod
for um you know some of his more controversial stands and stuff so.


 Sherri 
Uh-huh.


 Ron 
But and and so have you been following the uh the proposed nominees? I
mean do you think


 Sherri 
Kellogg, the Kellogg guy.


 Ron 
Oh yeah, that's right. Where's he going to Commerce? Is that where
he's headed?


 Sherri 
Yeah, that's it, huh?


 Ron 
Yeah, I don't know anything about him. I I don't know. Do you know
anything about him?


 Sherri 
Mm.  Well, all I know is that that's like a real prestigious uh
position, you know to be the what the ~CEO of Kellogg?


 Ron 
Yeah, yeah. I guess it sort of concerns me that uh you know we're
looking at yet uh another corporate head coming into the government. I


 Sherri 
Mm.  Ye- ye- you know, this is like a -- uh it's a re- -- I think we have
a real problem.  That is uh -- you know almost like a big beast you know
that's right there and we don't even identify it


 Ron 
Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.


 Sherri 
way way way more than we realize.


 Ron 
Yeah, I I think you're probably right and I think it -- maybe even
particularly true under this President, although I don't think it's
just limited to him. I think it's a common problem in the ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-18" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>.


 Sherri 
I f- -- I uh I think i- i- it's uh more evident now than ever.


 Ron 
Uh-huh, uh-huh


 Sherri 
You know, really um -- tremen- tremendously a ruling and reigning.


 Ron 
Did you um


 Sherri 
I think it it's a global uh has a global effect.


 Ron 
Yeah.


 Sherri 
I think that's why Al-Qaeda -- took down the the uh twin towers.  Eh w-
they were making a a statement.  Uh I think something like that
possibly, that it had to do with corporate America.


 Ron 
Uh-huh, you mean about the corporate thing?


 Sherri 
Hm?


 Ron 
Uh you mean because of its -- what it represented around corporate
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> or something? Is that what you think.


 Sherri 
I think what corporate <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> represents -- you know the the financial
scheme of it all, the


 Ron 
Uh-huh, uh-huh.


 Sherri 
the it just how it eff- effects the globe,


 Ron 
Mhm.


 Sherri 
and how eh it effects third world countries and you know just the
whole thing. It's just


 Ron 
Mhm, mhm.  Uh-huh.


 Sherri 
it's a you know like a a a wealthy despotism or something like that.


 Ron 
So any thoughts on who you uh you would name?


 Sherri 
(()) -- You know who I would name? I know this is really wild.


 Ron 
Do you suppose?  Uh-huh.


 Sherri 
But uh I don't know you'll probably really laugh but I don't know, I
I I always thought that -- Ralph Nader was kind of a a character


 Ron 
Oh.  Uh-huh.


 Sherri 
but what I really I mean I really listened to what he said when he was
being interviewed


 Ron 
Mhm.


 Sherri 
and in just a few words, he didn't mince any meat or anything,  in a
few words he said so much that was so


 Ron 
Uh-huh.


 Sherri 
like -- like a clarion call it rang so clear. You could hear what he was
saying and it was really making sense, and I think he's an expert


 Ron 
So who would y- what would you appoint him to?


 Sherri 
on


 Ron 
Any particular position? I mean, I think that's a good idea.


 Sherri 
eh -- there's something to do with the economy y- you know for the with
the to deal with the


 Ron 
Yeah.


 Sherri 
just uh -- like a an equa- e- economic equilibrium or something.


 Ron 
He might be be good at -- yeah, he might be good at commerce instead of
that Kellogg's guy.
