Interview With Howard Dean; Will <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Catch Saddam Hussein?

<TEXT>


 KING 
Before Senator Hutchison responds, Steve Kroft, you did that piece on the
seaports, right?


 KROFT 
I did, and Senator Graham's absolutely right. There has nothing been
done. I will say that it is a huge problem, and you've got hundreds of
thousands, millions of these containers, cargo containers, coming into
the country everyday, Lord only knows where from. Not good documentation,
you can't search all of them, the search may be 10 percent, physically.
Less than that, I believe. And like the border issue. I mean, some of
these problems are so staggering -- how do you deal with the border with
<PLACE country="MX" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18316662" id="Pl-2" latLong="23.000°N 102.000°W" mod="BORDER" type="COUNTRY">Mexico</PLACE>? How do you deal with the border with <PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-3" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" mod="BORDER" type="COUNTRY">Canada</PLACE>, where you in -- in
many case, you can just walk across a field in <PLACE continent="NA" country="US" form="NAM" gazref="igdb:663849" id="P-14" state="US-MN" type="CIVIL">Minnesota</PLACE>. You've got
supposedly, according to some <PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Canadian</PLACE> officials, 50 al Qaeda operatives
that they believe are there.


 KING 
Senator Hutchison, your response?


 HUTCHISON 
Well, I think that everyone is saying the same thing. We are very
concerned. This is a huge <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> and we have porous borders and our
ports are vulnerable. There's no question about it. And I know Steve did
a really strong piece on that just recently. And I think a lot is being
done, but are we finished, are we where we need to be, absolutely not.


 KING 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1513683" id="Pl-7" latLong="47.659°N 117.425°W" state="WA" type="PPL">Spokane</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-6" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">Washington</PLACE>, as we go to some calls. Hello.


 CALLER 
My question is for Senator Hutchison. Thank you for taking my call. She
states Saddam does have these weapons of mass destruction. In her
opinion, where are they if he does and why are our boys still dying after
the death of Uday and Qusay Hussein, what credibility does President Bush
have left after lying about...


 KING 
That's a lot of questions. Synthesize that Kay.


 HUTCHISON 
We know he has chemical weapons because he used them on his own people up
in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">north</PLACE> against the Kurds. And so with that kind of information, we
are looking for other evidence, and I think we will find it. But I don't
know where. But I do know that it is important that we continue to look
for it and find it. I am very concerned about the deaths of our soldiers,
that just seem to happen every day or every other day. And I think that
is keeping <PLACE continent="NA" country="US" form="NAM" gazref="igdb:840" id="P-15" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> on edge. But I do think finding Saddam Hussein will
make a big difference. We're not getting the cooperation from the people
because they are afraid that if they help Americans they will be killed
themselves or Saddam Hussein will come back and begin the torture of
these people who helped Americans. So, it has been very difficult for our
people to get the information that we need to find Saddam Hussein and
show the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people that this man is gone, and they will be able to
have a life if they will work with us give themselves a chance at
freedom.


 KING 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1660061" id="Pl-11" latLong="36.684°N 121.801°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Marina</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-10" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>, hello.


 CALLER 
Yes. I would like to ask either Robin or Steve why the media has not had
the courage to question the death of the 14-year-old boy when they got
Saddam's sons?


 KING 
Does that come up, Steve, we only got 30 seconds.


 KROFT 
Collateral damage. Unfortunately.


 WRIGHT 
He was shooting an AK-47 at them.


 KING 
The boy was?


 WRIGHT 
Yes. That is why. They didn't mean to kill a 14-year- old, but he was
shooting at them and they didn't know he was 14. That's what I saw and
heard.


 KING 
We're out of time. Thanks very much to all of you. We will be calling on
you again. Steve Kroft, the co-editor and correspondent of CBS
&quot;60-Minutes.&quot; Robin Wright of the &quot;<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328" id="Pl-12" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Los Angeles</PLACE> Times.&quot; Senator Bob
Graham, a candidate for his parties nomination. And Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison, Republican of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-13" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" state="TX" type="CIVIL">Texas</PLACE>. I'll be back in a couple minutes to tell
you about tomorrow night. Don't go away.
