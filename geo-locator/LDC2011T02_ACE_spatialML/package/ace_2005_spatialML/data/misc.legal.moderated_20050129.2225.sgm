 Question regarding simple assault &amp; battery 

My roommate was hospitalized in mid-November for lung surgery and spent several
days on loads of pain medication. On the fourth day of his stay, he was moved
out of the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-63" type="FAC">ICU</PLACE> to the step-down <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-65" type="FAC">unit</PLACE>, with a diagnosis of &quot;<PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-64" predicative="true" type="FAC">ICU</PLACE> Psychosis
secondary to narcotic administration&quot; and post thoracostomy.&quot; He was confused,
because of the medication but was not aggressive or threatening in any manner.
I saw him each day and as soon as we spoke, he became oriented and was
perfectly fine. This was witnessed by both the nursing staff and his doctors.

During the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day, he got up, dressed,
pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-54" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> and across
four lanes of busy evening traffic, to our <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-47" type="FAC">apartment</PLACE>. By the time he got to
our <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-48" type="FAC">home</PLACE>, he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly who
told me &quot;he's crazy and just walked out.&quot; I sat him down on the couch and
talked to him, and asked him what had happened. He said he'd asked for
something for pain and they told hime he couldn't have anything. Then the
orderly was apparently rude to him, and that's when he got up and decided to
come home. A short time later, two police officers showed up and told me they
had to take him back to the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-52" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE>. He went back with the officers, gave
them no problems at all. I received a call from the shift supervisor who told
me they'd replaced his chest tube, given him some pain medication and he was
doing much better. I told her to pass on the other shifts that if he became
confused or upset to call me, and I'd talk to him, and get him settled down.

At 2:15 the next morning, I received a call from the night shift supervisor who
told me my friend had been &quot;verbally abusive and aggressive&quot; and would I come
over and talk to him. So, I went over there, getting to his <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-55" type="FAC">room</PLACE> right at
2:30. There were two cops there and I asked what had happened. My roommate
was in bed, sound asleep, and had all of his clothes on. A nurse said, &quot;He
beat two of us up.
The cops are here because we're pressing charges.&quot; I've lived with this man 9
years and never in that time have I ever seen him be aggressive, violent or
abusive in anyway. I asked to speak to the two nurses whom he'd alledgedly hit
and was told I couldn't do that.

An hour or so passed and the got my roommate out of bed, took his chest tube
out and discharged him. He was sent to another <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-58" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> with a psych unit
until his psychosis resolved. I was given copies of a citation for simple
assault and battery, then went to the police <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-60" type="FAC">station</PLACE> several days later to find
out what other paperwork was available on this incident. I was given a copy of
a different citation, but with the identical information from the one I'd
gotten the night of the incident.
The police report has the victim saying she was &quot;choked to where she almost
lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large
marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks. According to the
police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the
injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this
incident. My roommate has no recollection of the time from the day before the
incident happened until he woke up at the other <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-59" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE>.

He was cited for simple assault and battery. If there is no evidence, and that
includes the belt buckle, how can the county prosecute this case.? All of his
belongings were returned to me upon his discharge, with the exception of the
belt buckle. The police do not have it and the hospital doesn't know what
happened to it. Also, I was looking at both citations, I didn't get to the
<PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-50" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> until 2:30 am, and the officer has the time of incident as being at
2:34 am. Does anyone besides me see a problem with any of this? What kind of
recourse does my roommate have in all of this?

You need an attorney right away. You are not going to be able
to poke holes in this case with Internet advice. In addition,
I's suggest raising the stakes. The hospital obviously knew
that your friend was having head problems, and they improperly
treated him by not sending him to a psych ward, which allowed
the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted
someone. Sue them for malpractice, and make the number big
enough to get some serious attention.

 Re: Question regarding simple assault &amp; battery 

    

Get a criminal defense lawyer (I don't say that very often on this
newsgroup).

If your roommate cannot afford one, contact your roommate's parents about
paying for one, or ask about getting a court appointed lawyer. Tell the
lawyer that you will help with the case (do administrative stuff, etc) in
any way that would help him/her defend your roommate.
