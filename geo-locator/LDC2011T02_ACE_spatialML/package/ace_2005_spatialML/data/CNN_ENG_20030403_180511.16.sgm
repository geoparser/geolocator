discern whether or not that is, in point of fact, the
missiles that we have become accustomed to striking <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE>

represent artillery barrages as fighting continues to take

saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline
of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE>. over the course of the past two weeks, since
this war began, something like 23,000 coalition sorties
have been flown, and over the course of the past 24 hours,
1,900 sorties flown. and we are told that, of those, 850
were strike sorties, motor vehicle most of those directed
against the republican guard. as you know, the republican
guard just outside <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> to defend the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> and saddam
hussein's regime, in principal. two of those divisions
absolutely devastated, destroyed. the so-called <PLACE country="SA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897380" id="Pl-21" latLong="30.965°N 47.255°E" predicative="true" state="SA-03" type="PPLA">medina</PLACE>
division, and the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" predicative="true" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> division. the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" predicative="true" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> division,
of course, getting its name from the fact that it is the
republican guard division designated to defend principally
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE>. four other divisions we are told have also been
hit very, very very hard and are principally trying to
reinforce units va also been hit very hard. so we are
seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are
calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one
person from the center of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="CENTRAL" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE>. and that raises
questions, questions that have been in front of us since
that first strike on march 19th against the location that
the cia military intelligence thought was a place where
saddam hussein, perhaps his sons, were. that preemptive
strike they put, i think somewhat elegantly, trying to
strike at the head of the snake. new explosions rocking
parts of <PLACE country="IQ" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> tonight. we will continue to monitor that.

the army and coalition forces do take control of <PLACE id="Pl-83" type="FAC">saddam
