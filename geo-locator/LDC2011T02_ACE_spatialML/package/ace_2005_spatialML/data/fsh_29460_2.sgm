 A 
Yeah, my mom was scared out of her mind. She's like, I'm just doing
this for you.


 B 
I mean, I couldn't imagine. Aw. Aw.


 A 
Just so you know, but I don't want to do it. She was hilarious
because she was, um, she saw the -- when when the first tower
hit -- she saw it, she called me and then when I tuned in, the second
tower hit like as soon as I tur- tuned in the phone -- the, um,
television.


 B 
Mhm. Oh, wow. Right.


 A 
Eh, he -- eh, she's like, oh my God, we're going to die and I'm over
there, you know, we're watching cartoons early in the morning.


 B 
Oh. Oh my goodness.


 A 
Um, and it was just horrible and I'm like, what is going on? I was
like...


 B

And then i- it's, eh, s- eh, then, eh, I'm trying not to freak
out my kids, either, and she's like Mommy, put Nick Junior on, what
are you doing? Um, so...


 B

 A 
And you see all these parents freaking out people in the -- in the
place where I live.


 B

 A 
Wh- what are you doing? They're like all the way uptown, you know,
but then, you know, we have friends down there that were working in
the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-3" state="NY" type="RGN">area</PLACE>.


 B 
Right.


 A 
And we're trying to figure who was where and you know, uh, um.


 B 
Oh.


 A 
Uh, we know -- we know a lady from our church that she was at work in
the building and and she was in the second tower and, um.


 B 
Oh my goodness.


 A 
Her supervisor was like, well, go back -- well, go back to work,
everything's fine, um, and they were getting back in the
elevator to go back down to the office. 


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
I guess they were going up.


 B 
Okay.


 A 
And, um, and she's like, you know what, I got a bad feeling. You
guys need to get out of that elevator and they're laughing at her, oh
you're so t- you know, you're such a -- oh, just being paranoid and
they're laughing.


 B 
Oh.  Right.


 A 
I mean, as soon as that door um closed the second tower hit so the elevator
where, you know, you hear the screams all the way down, she she said
she fainted.


 B 
Oh my goodness.


 A 
I mean, it was just, eh, traumatizing for her and she's like, you
know, I just -- all I remember are the screams.


 B 
Oh.


 A 
And then being carried down the steps.


 B 
Oh.


 A 
You know, another lady that I knew, she forgot her Bible.


 B 
Right.


 A 
Because she was late to work.


 B 
Okay.


 A 
And she was, um, she g- had gotten there just when all the commotion
started.


 B 
Right.


 A 
You know, so I was like, eh, say -- it was like one of those
days you forget your Bible and you just think to go back and pick it
up.


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
And you just, eh, happen to be late to work, you know, there was a a
lot of people that were late for work that day because of something.


 B 
Oh my goodness. Right.


 A 
My husband used to work in that <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-2" state="NY" type="RGN">area</PLACE> and he had just joined the marine
corps, so he was at school.


 B 
Oh.


 A 
You know, and I was just like, you know, ah...


 B 
Wow.


 A 
It was just really bad and then, you know, all our -- I had a couple
of doctor friends that were just ge- going down there, okay, I'm not
going to work, I'm going down there to help out, um.


 B 
Right.


 A 
You know, there's just only so much you can do and there's huge lines
of people trying to help.


 B 
Right.


 A 
And they were just like, well, you -- just turning them down.


 B 
Well, because they're just probably in the way at that point.


 A 
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was just, ah...


 B 
Wow.


 A 
Very scary.


 B 
That is very scary.


 A 
Yeah. Yeah.


 B 
That's, you know -- it's one thing to hear about it on the news
but it's another thing to hear about it from somebody who was there
an- or, you know, like...


 A 
Yeah. Yeah.


 B 
No wonder your mom was afraid. Eh, even...


 A 
Yeah, she was freaking out. She didn't get on the train because ever -- 
um, right under, um, the twin towers is this train station, it
was <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-4" state="NY" type="ROAD">fiftieth street</PLACE>.


 B 
Right.


 A 
So, the people that were on the train at that time were g- you know,
or s- either stuck or dead down there. So, there were, um, she
would not go on the train. They had to really, truly, um, change the
way the train stations were and change the, um, the the stops and 
and and th- some train because they they couldn't...


 B 
Oh.


 A 
Nobody could go down there,  um, or close by there or anything and
then all the...


 B 
Right.


 A 
I had a friend that was cleaning houses that day and she said -- she's
like, I look out the window and I'm thinking, oh there's a fire in the
building.


 B 
Oh.


 A 
I was like, that was the first tower and it was burning and she was
like, are you serious?


 B 
Oh my goodness.


 A 
Ain't that right? She didn't know, so she kept cleaning.


 B 
Oh. Wow.


 A 
And it was in the s- -- it was -- she was probably, like, two blocks
away.


 B 
Wow.


 A 
And then she's hearing the screaming and the commotion, everybody's
trying to evacuate because all the surrounding buildings were, um, 
th- eh, w- they were in danger, too. A lot of the buildings were not
-- no good, they could not -- you know, trying to get all the -- there
were schools around there, little children's schools.


 B 
Oh.


 A 
So, they were trying to get all the kids out before the the buildings
came down. I mean, it was just a mess.


 B 
Oh my goodness.


 A 
It was a mess. We just trying to make sure that we knew where
everybody was. You know, so it took a while. It took us a couple
days to kind of make sure that everyone -- eh, you know, my church is
pretty big, just to make sure that everyone that was down there or in
the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-5" state="NY" type="RGN">vicinity</PLACE> was okay.


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
And, um, ho- you know, thank God that everyone was fine. You
know, we had a- uh, of course those -- scared those people that
were a- were actually in there that were carried out by the f- by
the, um, uh, fire department.


 B 
Wow.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
That is just...


 A 
So.


 B 
Oh i-


 A 
Yeah, I know, I know. And then, you know, there's also o- the people
that were supposed to be on that flight, that they didn't make it or,
um, that they switched or they just didn't get on or
something. You know, it's just like, oh my goodness.


 B 
Right. Yep. Oh, yeah.
