Has the EU once again lost its mind? The one industry in which <PLACE continent="EU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-1" type="CONTINENT">Europe</PLACE>
incontrovertibly beats the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> is their aviation industry , thanks mainly
to the fact that their lawmakers have left the operation of the industry
up to the people who own it, and left passenger's rights in the hands of
choosy passengers. And now they're ready to 'fix' that with a new
package of ill-advised rules completely changing the nature of airlines
. Before, a potential customer could choose between a cosy, near-certain
ride from an expensive company or a hustled, uncomfortable, and absurdly
cheap one from a smaller competitor. And now? Not a chance.
