2. Workplace Culture Describe the organizational structure of your
current or former workplace. How many people work there, and what is
the hierarchy?  Who works for whom?  What kind of job do you have?
Describe some of the people that you work with and the jobs they do.
Do you think your company is well-run?  If not, what could make it
better?


 B 
And then we're not supposed to answer it. Well, um all I can say about
big corporations -- is there's too many -- chiefs.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
Always too many chiefs. And with the constant merging with other
banks,


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
ugh err.


 A 
Or well, and then you think of things like Enron.


 B 
Oh yeah.


 A 
I mean,  you got -- corrupted chiefs too.


 B 
Yeah, they're everywhere. The uh ~CEO we had before we merged with
Nations Bank -- he uh -- he about ran as into the ground with some hedge
funds that he had gone into.


 A 
Uh-huh.


 B 
And then, and then when we finish merging, they give the guy something
like a twenty-five million dollar package, and if he dies, his family
still gets all the money.


 A 
No way.


 B 
Yeah.  No.  They wouldn't do anything like that for me.  I've been
there for a long time, I used to be a manager there. There's no way
I'd get that kind of a -- oh.  So, yeah, once you get way up there,
unless you're prosecuted,  you you just -- are constantly rolling in the
dough.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
And that was a long time ago, and we just c- oh, all that money,  for
just about bankrupting us.  That is crazy.  I think that was in ninety
seven or eight


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
I think we merged in ninety-eight.  So, yeah, Bank of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE>'s
everywhere.  And um -- Mm -- Gosh I can't think of anything else to say
about them.  I don't know.  They're all right. They have good
benefits.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
Not good pay.


 A 
Yeah.  Yeah I I'm not really familiar with the working world that
much.  So, I mean, with my part-time job, it's a lot it's really good
for a student, because I only work uh two hours a night.


 B 
Oh that's good.


 A 
So, yeah, and then it's pretty flexible.  Like uh -- uh I'm pretty busy
with other, you know -- student organizations, and hanging out with
friends and stuff, so I don't have to work on the weekends, and then I
can take off sometimes. So.


 B 
Yeah.  That's good.


 A 
So a pretty good deal, and the cool thing about is like -- everybody at
work is really friendly,


 B 
Yeah, that's good.


 A 
and uh I think really that what brings that on is our boss. Like he's
just a really nice guy, and -- he's pretty laid back.  So.


 B 
That comes in handy.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
Got to have a good boss.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
I don't know if there's any pudding in the refrigerator honey. You got
to go -- I I think you ate it all, but go look around -- I know there's
still some more um Trix yogurt.  And I'll buy pudding on Friday.  He's
all upset with me cause there's no pudding.  Yeah, I've had many many
different kinds of managers, and when they're laid back don't micro-
manage -- you know, you definitely,  work harder for them, and do a
better job and


 A 
Yeah. Did you ever see the uh movie Office Space?


 B 
yes, I did.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
Yes I did. It took me a second, but I sure did.


 A 
Yeah.  I always think about that like -- or a lot of I think college
students think about that like with some office jobs, you know?


 B 
Yeah.  It's uh


 A 
So.  It's kind of like, that's the job that they're t- everyone's
trying to stay away from.


 B 
Yeah.  I don't think they're quite -- They they've gotten better. I know
the bigger companies have tried to -- stay away from that, cause uh -- The
the that does wear you out. I remember Bank of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> was -- kind of
like that in the department I used to work in, years and years ago.


 A 
Uh-huh.


 B 
Oh my God.  Boring looking walls, boring people, boring job.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
It it drained the life out of you whenever we had to go to work. It
just -- sucked.


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
But they tried to make it more entertaining. I think more companies
are going for the uh -- you know, employee satisfaction.  Finally.


 A 
Uh-huh.


 B 
Th- that was the Bank's big deal last year, was uh ninety percent
associate satisfaction.  And they were all happy when they finally got
there.  But we didn't get anything for it.  They didn't like give
everybody bonuses or anything.  Sheesh.  They because they got some
better insurance policies and some better -- bonuses that they paid out
at the end of the month and -- you know, it was a little better.


 A 
Yeah, well, you got to make your employees happy, otherwise you're not
going to come out with the next product.  You know?


 B 
That's right. They're not going to work so hard for ya. They're going
to call out sick


 A 
Yep.


 B 
they're going to do -- you know, half-assed job.  That's exactly the way
it is.


 A 
It's just basic management.


 B 
Mhm. Exactly.  Mikey hold on, I'll be off the phone in a minute.


 A 
((Sure))


 B 
Sheesh.


 A 
Yeah.  I also, I worked for uh, like kind of like a Subway, uh <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:352615" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.749°N 84.388°W" predicative="true" state="US-GA" type="PPL">Atlanta</PLACE>
