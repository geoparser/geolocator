1 day to glory...

Well, it's mid-morning on the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208918467" id="Pl-3" mod="E" type="RGN">East coast</PLACE> and I am sitting here
running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what's going to happen
in the Iron Bowl, which is just over 29 hours away.

The game is being played in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:154742" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.210°N 87.569°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Tuscaloosa</PLACE>, which should be an advantage
to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-5" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE>. However, In the two times the game has been played in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-199" state="US-AL" type="FAC">Bryant
Denny Stadium</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-18" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> has won.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-6" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> has one of the stingiest defenses in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-27" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, and were
ranked number one in overall defense as recently as last week.
Conversely, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> has one of the most potent and balanced offensive
attacks in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-29" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE>. Also, I don't think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-12" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> has faced an attack with
two great runners, a great line, a poised QB and good receivers and a
tight end as well.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-13" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> is missing it's starting offensive backfield from the start of
the season. The fact that they've won six games is a testament to the
coaching and heart of the players.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-7" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> simply cannot throw the football, which is a good thing,
because <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-20" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>'s defensive backfield is second to none. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-14" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> can run the
ball however. Unfortunately for them, with no passing game to keep the
defense honest, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-21" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> will probably stack nine in the box, play man on
the corners, and dare <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-15" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> to run, and I don't think they'll be able to
do it.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-22" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> is also 9-0 when they score first. The Tuberville way is to
get one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you're at home and
to quiet the other team's crowd if you're on the road.

You can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games. In this
exact game 15 years ago, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-16" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> came into <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-23" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> #2 in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-26" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>,
undefeated at 10-0 and looking for yet another <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-30" type="COUNTRY">national</PLACE> championship.
They were summarily trounced 30-20 in a game in which the score was
closer than the actual game. That could very well happen Saturday.

I always tell people that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-1" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL">Georgia</PLACE> game matters more to me than
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-17" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> game. I live in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-2" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL">Georgia</PLACE>, and losing that game affects me much
more directly than losing the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-8" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> game. That said, when kickoff time
comes, you remember all the reasons that you hate <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-9" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> and their
dumbass haircuts and their detergent and toilet paper and their
houndstooth hats and their &quot;Bear this&quot; and &quot;Bear that,&quot; and everything
else that goes along with it. This isn't a football game, and it's not
two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion. This is brother
against brother after one slept with the other's wife and then bragged
about it. It's THAT serious.

However, when it's all said and done, I just don't think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-10" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> has
the horses to stand up to what I believe is going to be enormous
defensive pressure. If <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-24" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> takes care of the ball and executes, this
game shouldn't be as close as some think.

My call:

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-25" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> 37

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-11" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> 13

Now pass the Tums. I don't feel so well...

War Eagle!!
