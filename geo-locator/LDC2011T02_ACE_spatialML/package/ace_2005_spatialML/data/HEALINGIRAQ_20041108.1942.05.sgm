The interim government declared a state of emergency in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
excluding the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> region for 60 days, according to the National
Security Law introduced last August which states that emergency laws can
be declared in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-38" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> for a period no more than 60 days provided a
serious threat against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> national security is recognised by the
interim government.

Obviously, this is a necessary step that should have been taken at
least two months ago. Suicide bombings and guerrilla attacks carried out
by insurgents and foreign terrorists based around <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> have escalated
to alarming levels particularly during Ramadan.

Deputy governor of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16895137" id="Pl-20" latLong="35.067°N 45.767°E" state="DI" type="CIVIL">Diyala</PLACE> along with several council members from
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896216" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.750°N 44.641°E" state="DI" type="PPLA">Ba'quba</PLACE> were ambushed and killed in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897396" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.028°N 44.175°E" state="BB" type="PPL">Latifiya</PLACE> <SIGNAL id="S-1">south</SIGNAL> of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, an <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897396" id="Pl-37" latLong="33.028°N 44.175°E" state="BB" type="RGN">area</PLACE>
which has supposedly been 'cleared' from insurgents a couple of weeks
ago. Four suicide attacks in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16889595" id="Pl-23" latLong="34.167°N 43.833°E" state="SD" type="PPLA">Samarra</PLACE>, also a recently 'liberated' area,
against National Guard units and the governorate building. Zarqawi's
group claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Three police stations in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16894456" id="Pl-24" latLong="34.140°N 42.378°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Haditha</PLACE>, a small <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16894456" id="Pl-26" latLong="34.140°N 42.378°E" state="AN" type="PPL">town</PLACE> <SIGNAL id="S-2">west</SIGNAL> of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896976" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.424°N 43.303°E" state="AN" type="PPLA">Ramadi</PLACE>, were
assaulted by groups of insurgents. Some 30 policemen were captured, tied
up and executed in cold blood against the walls following a
confrontation which lasted two hours. Zarqawi's group, again, claiming
responsibility.

A full-scale military operation against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Fallujah</PLACE>, which is apparently
underway already, seems to be the government's 'final solution'. I'm not
optimistic to the outcome, especially when significant civilian
casualties are unavoidable.

Note, that I'm not suggesting a peaceful or political solution would
work either in these areas. Insurgents west of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> have quite
obstinately made it clear that nothing but full control of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-39" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>,
or at least the Anbar governorate, will satisfy them. They have refused
to participate in the political process, they have repeatedly announced
their intentions to boycott the elections and to disrupt them in other
areas, and they do not recognise the government or any other authority
in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-40" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> beside themselves.

The demands of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Fallujah</PLACE> negotiants from the government weeks ago
were obscene and they clearly reflect the overt sectarianism and
regionalism of the armed groups in the area. The demands were not
released to the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> public at the time for unkown reasons but they
have leaked out days ago. Here are just a few of them:

-A clear timetable for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces
(fair enough).

-Immediate withdrawal of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> and <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> security forces from the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897886" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.367°N 43.717°E" state="AN" type="CIVIL">Anbar</PLACE>
governorate and the handover of security responsibilities to former army
officers from <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897886" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.367°N 43.717°E" state="AN" type="CIVIL">Anbar</PLACE>.

-The appointment of ministers from the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897886" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.367°N 43.717°E" state="AN" type="CIVIL">Anbar</PLACE> governorate to the
ministries of Interior, Defense, Oil and Finance.

-The removal of certain officials (most of them from Shi'ite Islamic
parties such as Ibrahim Al-Ja'fari) from governmental positions.

-The complete return of Ba'athists, army officers, Republican Guards,
Mukhabarat, intelligence and security personnel to their former
positions.

-The removal of Shi'ite Edhan (call for prayers) from official
television and radio programs.

-Incomes of Shi'ite sacred shrines should be returned under the
control of the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs.

These last two demands have been allegedly added by Sheikh Harith
Al-Dhari (head of the Association of Muslim Scholars) and are said to
have been a major reason behind the failure of negotiations with the
government.

Iraqis here in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">south</PLACE> were shocked to hear of these demands and
sectarian tensions are on the rise. It scares me to see the reaction of
people around me whenever <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Fallujah</PLACE> is mentioned. The director of a
primary health care clinic was remarking the other day that &quot;<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Fallujah</PLACE>
should be burnt upon its residents and then razed to the ground. They
are the sons of Mu'awiya, may Allah curse them all.&quot; Sidenote: Mu'awiya
bin Abi Sufyan was the governor of <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-31" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE> during the 7th century and he
fought Imam Ali bin Abi Talib (Muhammed's son-in-law) over the Caliphate
after the assassination of Caliph Othman. He became the first Ummayid
Caliph and two decades later, under the Caliphate of his son Yazid, Imam
Hussein bin Ali (grandson of Muhammed) was killed by his armies at
present day <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923" id="Pl-36" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="KA" type="CIVIL">Karbala</PLACE>. Someone hushed the director and pointed out to him
that I'm Sunni. He was a bit embarrassed and tried to explain that he
was referring to Wahhabis and foreign fighters. It was a bit
uncomfortable and I could feel that people were giving me furtive
glances.

Refugees have been pouring out of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Fallujah</PLACE> over the last few days
into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and the surrounding areas. The military operation will
undoubtly aggravate the humanitarian situation inside the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-32" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">city</PLACE> since
there are definitely thousands of families with no place to go. Refugees
in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> have confirmed the rumours that the 'Mujahideen' are forcing
men from 15-50 years old to stay and that they were threatened with
execution if they refuse to carry arms in defense of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-41" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">town</PLACE>. Majlis
Shura Al-Mujahideen (The Mujahideen Advisory Council) are in control of
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Fallujah</PLACE> and they have distributed a statement inviting Arab and foreign
(including <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-33" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE>) media reporters to enter the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-34" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">town</PLACE> and cover the
battles. The statement carried the insignia of Zarqawi's group Qa'idat
Al-Jihad .

Everyone is closely watching what the next few days will bring,
hoping the violence doesn't spread to the streets of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> or other
areas. I'm still holed up in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16887111" id="Pl-35" latLong="30.500°N 47.850°E" state="BA" type="CIVIL">Basrah</PLACE> but I'll try to be on the road as
soon as possible.
