A REAL RACE FOR GOVERNOR

<TEXT>

If there are three in the race for governor it takes 33.4% to win. If
there are four does it take 25.1% to win?

If so, what about this scenario? George Fitch does not smoke out
Kilgore and Kilgore gets the Republican nomination in spite of his tax
and spend hidden agenda. Then Fitch runs as an independent. Fitch has
nothing to lose having alienated the party regulars.

This provides a true conservative (Fitch) and a true old timey
Business-As-Usual (Potts) for the voters to choose between. Potts gets
the money from the Road Gang, Fitch gets energy and grass roots support
from those who want fundamental change. Either one could get over 25.1%

Kilgore and Kaine are left with the party regulars. This is a problem
because as the two &quot;major&quot; parties have fine tuned their ability to win
two-way races by 51% they become more vulnerable to attacks from someone
outside the club.

By avoiding the issues that will cause them to lose rather than
stressing what they stand for, the &quot;major&quot; parties have shrunk their
tent and have fewer active members as a percentage of eligible voters.
In fact both are minority parties, especially if you count those who do
not bother to vote.

Could be interesting.

I'd just like to point out that Mark Warner's approval ratings are
hovering around 70%. So we know that at least one member of one of the
parties is BELOVED by HUGE majority of Virginians.

Paul:

You are right, his approval ratings are higher than most recent
governors. There are probably other individuals in both parties who
would be well liked if the did as well as he has.

I would not call Warner a party candidate in the sence that Kilgore
and Kaine are. As I recall he funded a big part of his effort to get
moninated, as well as his campaign, he did not run on the typical party
platform.

But how does any of that impact the upcoming election? Warner cannot
run again.

That's true - he ran away from his party label from the start.

So the question is: How does Kaine differ from Warner? I guess it's
guns, abortion, and the death penalty.

It's an intriguing scenario. At this point, I'm sure Fitch would
disavow any interest in running as an independent. But the possibilities
are intriguing. Another factor working in his favor as an independent --
but not as a Republican -- is the fact that he would have the strongest
environmental platform of the bunch. Being an environmentalist doesn't
do much for you in the Republican Party, but, in theory, it should help
him cut into a core constituency of the Democratic Party.

(I say, in theory, because I believe that most environmentalists are
Democrats first, environmentalists second. There's very little
difference between the environmental policies of Gilmore and Warner, but
the environmentalists lobbyists who vilified Gilmore have been
remarkably quiet about Warner.)

Once Fitch runs in the Republican primary, he cannot later run as an
independent if he loses the primary election. This is prohibited by
statute. Otherwise, the primary loser could always run as an
independent, if for nothing else, just to become a spoiler. This would
defeat the entire notion of a Polical Party primary contest.

It is obvious that Kilgore is at a considerable disadvantage. He has
a primary challenge on his hands and then an independent candidate
positioned to drain off the moderate Republican vote.

Kaine has all the Democrats to himself and is in a good position to
win independents. All he has to do is run a solid campaign and he is the
next governor of <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-1" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE>.

I agree with Ed and Paul, that Mark Warner won by &quot;running away from
his party.&quot; He also ran a smart race.

Perhaps Democrats should take notice.

Let's be clear - Kilgore's proposed tax and spend proposals put him
in the same camp as Governor Gilmore. This election will shape up to be
a battle between Warner and Gilmore's policies more than Kaine and
Kilgore.

If Kilgore's philosophy on appropriate governmental staff levels is
the same as his approach to appropriate paid campaign staff levels it
looks like <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> may be the first full employment act state. Good
lord Kilgore is paying an army to run his campaign already in March.
