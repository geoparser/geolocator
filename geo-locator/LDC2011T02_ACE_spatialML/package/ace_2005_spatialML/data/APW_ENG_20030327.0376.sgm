Kurdish militiamen and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> special operations troops linked up with
more than 1,000 <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Army paratroopers Thursday to secure the area
around a strategic air strip, as the first large coalition ground
force in northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> began opening another front against Saddam
Hussein's regime.

The Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade , including elite Army Rangers,
jumped out of low-flying C-17 transport planes under cover of
darkness Wednesday and secured a snow-dusted airfield, which will be
used to bring in supplies and support personnel.

The airdrop  _	one of the biggest paratroop drops in decades  _ was
a dramatic entry for ground troops into a region where only small
groups of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> special forces have been operating. Coalition
airstrikes have been hitting <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> military forces and other
strategic targets in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-34" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">north</PLACE>.

``This tightens the noose against Saddam's forces battling coalition
forces to the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-31" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">south</PLACE>,'' Brig. Gen. James Parker, commander of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>

forces.''

Giving cover for the deployment, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> warplanes struck <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> ground
troops and bunkers in northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. Three waves of combat planes
from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt hit ``ground troops,
command and control bunkers, artillery positions and ... a surface to
air missile battery,'' said Lt. John Oliveira, the ship's public
affair officer.

Around dawn Thursday, strikes resumed, with a massive explosion just
outside the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-61" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> zone close to the village of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16894998" id="Pl-40" latLong="36.264°N 43.648°E" state="TS" type="PPL">Kalak</PLACE>. Warplanes

Later Thursday, Kurdish troops in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16895613" id="Pl-44" latLong="35.537°N 44.832°E" state="SW" type="PPL">Chamchamal</PLACE> advanced their positions
between government-controlled and rebel-controlled areas, taking over
a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> check point on their front with no fighting at this point,
witnesses said.

Early Thursday, Kurdish fighters closed off a highway and roads near
the airstrip where troops were said to be arriving, outside the town
of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="igdb:16896075" id="Pl-46" latLong="36.511°N 44.333°E" state="AR" type="PPL">Bashur</PLACE>, <SIGNAL id="S-3">about 30 miles (50 kilometers)</SIGNAL> <SIGNAL id="S-6">northeast</SIGNAL> of the

From the highway, dusted from a recent snow, a flashing light from
the airstrip's control tower was visible in the distance, and three
helicopters could be seen landing, flying with nearly all their
lights extinguished.

Future airlifts into the area will include supplies and support
personnel for the 173rd's fighters, defense officials said. The
airfield's 6,700-foot (2,042-meter) runway is long enough to land
C-17s and other <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> military cargo planes.

Lt. Col. Thomas Collins, a spokesman for the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Army's <PLACE continent="EU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-48" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">Southern
European</PLACE> Task Force, refused to say whether the paratroopers deployed
directly from <PLACE country="IT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19880600" id="Pl-49" latLong="42.833°N 12.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Italy</PLACE> into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> or had taken a different route.

The matter immediately sparked controversy in <PLACE country="IT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19880600" id="Pl-50" latLong="42.833°N 12.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Italy</PLACE>, where there is a
strong anti-war movement. The <PLACE country="IT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19880600" id="Pl-51" latLong="42.833°N 12.833°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s parliament voted this month
to allow <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>-led coalition forces to use <PLACE country="IT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19880600" id="Pl-52" latLong="42.833°N 12.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Italian</PLACE> air space and
military bases	_  but not for directs attacks on <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

Pentagon officials have said for weeks they would have <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces in
northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> to open another front against Saddam's forces. The vast
majority of the coalition ground troops in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> are moving toward
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-53" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> from the south after entering from <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892118" id="Pl-54" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>.

Pentagon officials had hoped to have the Army's 4th Infantry Division
invade <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> from the north, but <PLACE country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="Pl-37" latLong="39.000°N 35.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Turkey</PLACE> balked at allowing up to
62,000 <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops on its soil to prepare for that option. The use of
the 173rd shows the military has shifted to a smaller, lighter force.

Military officials say they would have liked to have secured key oil
fields around the northern cities of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-55" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE> and <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892885" id="Pl-56" latLong="35.468°N 44.392°E" state="TS" type="PPLA">Kirkuk</PLACE>  _  and perhaps
the cities themselves  _  by now.

Though no hostilities were expected during the deployment, the 173rd
decided to parachute in rather then ferry troops in by plane so that
a significant combat force could mass almost immediately to protect
itself, officers said, according to a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> reporter traveling with
the 173rd.

``<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892885" id="Pl-57" latLong="35.468°N 44.392°E" state="TS" type="PPLA">Kirkuk</PLACE> is key. The Iraqi's want it, the Kurds want it, the Turks
want it and various other ethnic groups also want it,'' Maj. Mike
Hastings said. ``What this drop means is that we can secure it until
we are relieved by other forces.''

Besides <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-59" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE> and <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892885" id="Pl-58" latLong="35.468°N 44.392°E" state="TS" type="PPLA">Kirkuk</PLACE>, another key target in northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> is

circle. Most of the Adnan Division of the Republican Guard relocated
from the Mosul area to the Tikrit area shortly before the war began.

Another key mission for the 173rd could be to keep order in northern
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, which is controlled by two semi-autonomous Kurdish factions but
also includes several splinter groups and a base for the
al-Qaida-linked Ansar al-Islam.

<PLACE country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="Pl-38" latLong="39.000°N 35.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Turkey</PLACE> has said it may send more troops into northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> to prevent
refugees from moving north, while <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> officials have said they
advised <PLACE country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="Pl-39" latLong="39.000°N 35.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Turkey</PLACE> against sending large additional forces into northern
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="PPL">Iraq</PLACE>.
