With <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces rolling closer and closer to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, the military seems
to be zeroing in on the ground war. But, as it has from the beginning,
air power remains an important part of the battle. Let's check in with
CNN's Gary Tuchman at an air <PLACE id="Pl-357" type="FAC">base</PLACE> <SIGNAL id="S-3">near</SIGNAL> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. Gary you've seen it
firsthand from the first moments.


 GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT 
Well, that's right, Judy. In two weeks after the air war began, there is
no let-up and no effective response from the Iraqis. According to the Air
Force, at any given time, there are more 200 coalition aircraft either
over <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, flying to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> or flying from <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. We come to you from a <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-349" type="FAC">base</PLACE>
<SIGNAL id="S-4">near</SIGNAL> the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> border. Many pilots are flying these A-10 attack planes
behind me. They also fly F-16s. There are also Marine FA-18s and Marine
Heriers at this <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-350" type="FAC">base</PLACE>. We can tell you that a lot of pilots of this <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-351" type="FAC">base</PLACE>
are not flying to another base in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. It's a <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-325" type="FAC">base</PLACE> that was taken over
by the coalition last week. And we spent part of the day at that <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-327" type="FAC">base</PLACE>.
And when you arrive there, you are greeted in a sense by Saddam Hussein.

 TUCHMAN 
This is <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-358" type="PPL">Talil</PLACE>, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. The <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-343" type="FAC">Talil Air Base</PLACE>. But the are no more Iraqis here,
the coalition took over this <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-329" type="FAC">base</PLACE> last week. It's now a major staging
point. You know you are in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> when you drive down the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-348" type="FAC">road</PLACE> coming into
the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-332" type="FAC">base</PLACE> and see the portrait of Saddam Hussein. What's happen is the
military personnel who have arrived here have taken out their markers and
are writing messages on Saddam Hussein's portrait. You can see the main
one here on the bottom and also here messages like, we won, April 1,
2003. Want to give you a look. There's a lot of security personnel here.
You can look over there and you can see the military vehicles. These are
Air Force Security Forces with their rifles patrolling the entrance.
There is a lot of fighting in this area. We're near the town of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897120" id="Pl-16" latLong="31.054°N 46.259°E" state="IQ-DQ" type="PPLA">Nasiriya</PLACE>.
But this <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-334" type="FAC">base</PLACE> now is considered secure enough to make it a major staging
point for the coalition.

 TUCHMAN 
A short time ago we talked to a pilot at this <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-352" type="FAC">base</PLACE> who has been to that
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-337" type="FAC">base</PLACE> and he too says he has signed that mural right on Saddam
Hussein's sash. After he told us that, we asked him during his missions,
and he's flown about 30 in the last two weeks, we asked him does he still
have any artillery being fired at him?

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Yesterday I was up <SIGNAL id="S-2">just south</SIGNAL> of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> by <SIGNAL id="S-1">30 miles</SIGNAL> and we were fighting
SA-2s and SA-6s and AAA on the ground. So they're still out there. But
the air power and the air package that we take to the fight, we continue
to be effective. And we attrit the <PLACE country="SA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897380" id="Pl-18" latLong="30.965°N 47.255°E" predicative="true" state="SA-03" type="PPL">Medina</PLACE> forces down to less than 50
percent. And when we put our power punch to them and then the Army and
the Marines move forward it's a very effective, coordinated effort.

 TUCHMAN 
Lieutenant Colonel Webb (ph) is telling us he has a mission this very
evening. We want to tell you the Air Force has just informed us that
between this morning and tomorrow morning, it will fly 1,900 sorties into
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. A total over the last two weeks now of close to 24,000 sorties.
Before we go, one more thing we want to tell you about, superstitions.
Military people are very superstitious, like many of us are. Here at this
particular <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-353" type="FAC">base</PLACE> they get their MREs, their MREs are their Meals Ready to
Eat. They come in a bag. And when you get an MRE you get your meal and
you get a little treat with it. What a lot of people here at this <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-355" type="FAC">base</PLACE>
do, when their treat happens to be this one, this is the candy called
Charms, many of the people refuse to eat their Charms. They consider it a
good luck charm to keep their Charms in their clothes and not to eat
them. So one little superstitious tale for you, Judy. Back to you.


 WOODRUFF 
Well, I'm one of those who thinks that we need to pay attention to our
superstitions. Gary, one another quick question for you. That air <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-345" type="FAC">base</PLACE>
that coalition forces have now taken control of near <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897120" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.054°N 46.259°E" state="IQ-DQ" type="PPLA">Nasiriya</PLACE>. Are you
able to say, are they actually using it or getting much use out of it?


 TUCHMAN 
What they are doing, Judy, some of these A-10s behind me go there to
refuel, to stage operations further north. They also fly these HH-60
helicopters, they're the search and rescue helicopters used in case they
have to search and find somebody on the ground. They stage there and
refuel. But right now, none of them are permanently based there, although
the plan is for that to eventually happen.


 WOODRUFF 
All right, Gary Tuchman with some Charms. You saw him holding it. I will
be talking with a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Senator Joe Biden, just ahead, for his take on how the war is
going. Could Tony Blair be in line for a gold medal? Tales of how some in
Congress want to honor the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-19" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> prime minister.
