 John 
Oh, okay.


 Ivan 
Yeah.


 John 
Cool.  Um, man I thought I, uh,  put this whole election stuff behind
me.


 Ivan 
Yeah, I- in fact, I thought we already had a discussion on this, uh,
about elections some time back, but I guess it was -- question was
framed differently, I guess.


 John 
Uh-huh.  Well, um,


 Ivan 
Yeah.


 John 
I did vote.


 Ivan 
Mhm.


 John 
And, um, elections wore me down. I was pretty tired of all that,  you
know,  all the commercials and all the hype and -- I don't know. It it
we have lunch at work and -- the whole lunch time all you do is see
commercials about the -- politicians and,  you know, all that kind of
stuff, um,


 Ivan 
Mhm.


 John 
yeah.


 Ivan 
Yeah, I, uh,  I voted.


 John 
Uh-huh.


 Ivan 
Um,  uh, and, uh, yeah, I -- feel the same way. I get -- regardless of
what year it is or who the candidates are I get tired of listening to
it. It -- basically all of it's the same thing all the time and, uh,


 John 
Uh-huh.


 Ivan 
they, uh,  tell you the same thing and then they turn around and -- do
something different all the time anyway, so it's -- I don't know if
it's, uh,  I guess it's wor- -- worth voting, but -- sometimes I wonder.


 John 
Right.  Right.  Wasn't, uh, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780806" id="Pl-5" latLong="44.500°N 90.000°W" state="US-WI" type="CIVIL">Wisconsin</PLACE> was like a swing, er, uh,  they
were really pu- or no it was <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1086497" id="Pl-14" latLong="40.250°N 83.000°W" state="US-OH" type="CIVIL">Ohio</PLACE>, I think, was the really, uh,


 Ivan 
Yeah, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1086497" id="Pl-15" latLong="40.250°N 83.000°W" state="US-OH" type="CIVIL">Ohio</PLACE> was th- the big swing one. It was


 John 
big upset.  Right.


 Ivan 
fairly close here,


 John 
It was, yeah.


 Ivan 
uh,  uh, it was, uh,  it went, uh, what color was it? Blue I guess it
was.


 John 
Right.


 Ivan 
And, uh,


 John 
My -- uh-huh.


 Ivan 
yeah, go ahead.


 John 
Well, my parents live back there still.


 Ivan 
Uh-huh.


 John 
In fact, we just got back from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-237" state="US-FL" type="FAC">Disney World</PLACE>,  you know, about an hour
ago and they're down there and they're but they're both, uh,


 Ivan 
Oh.


 John 
one's one and one's the other


 Ivan 
Uh-huh.


 John 
so they arg- you know, they just go and vote and cancel each other
out, you know.


 Ivan 
Yeah, uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.


 John 
And, uh,  kind of funny,  so.  Um,  I don't know. I guess we'll just
have to see what happens with, uh, Mr. Bush.  Hopefully it's -- good
choice,  you know,


 Ivan 
Mhm.


 John 
I don't know.


 Ivan 
Wow, you really-


 John 
I di- I didn't have a lot of faith in any of them, really,


 Ivan 
nah.


 John 
er, I mean, I -- I didn't really know what was the perfect choice.


 Ivan 
No, they're, ah, I can't ever remember a perfect choice and I've been
voting since,  uh, Nixon McGovern, uh, so


 John 
Right.


 Ivan 
I, uh,  I'd- I've never -- ever seen a perfect candidate.


 John 
Right.


 Ivan 
But that's


 John 
Yeah.


 Ivan 
th- that's to be expected, I mean, you know, they're all human beings.


 John 
Can't please everybody.


 Ivan 
Yeah.  Yep.  And, uh, as far as what I thought of the various
candidates,  uh,  you know, I guess we -- said what we said about Bush,
but, uh,  Kerry, I don't know, it's just that -- -coast,  uh, kind of
persona or image,  -t, uh, I -- don't care for, for one thing.


 John 
Uh-huh.


 Ivan 
From <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:607926" id="Pl-16" latLong="42.250°N 71.500°W" state="US-MA" type="CIVIL">Massachusetts</PLACE> i- -- -candidate.


 John 
Right.


 Ivan 
And, uh,  Cheney -- which he's kind of out your way, uh, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780807" id="Pl-17" latLong="43.000°N 107.500°W" state="US-WY" type="CIVIL">Wyoming</PLACE>.


 John 
Uh-huh.


 Ivan 
Uh,  uh, he's kind of a non-descript person, as far as, like I I'm
sure he's he's probably a nice guy, and -- a lot of fun at a party
probably, I don't know, but,  you know,  just from -- what you see of
him, he's just kind of -- kind of like an old grandpa, you know.


 John 
Yeah, he's real grouchy.


 Ivan 
Yeah, he just


 John 
In those debates he was like a pitbull.


 Ivan 
Yeah, yeah.


 John 
You know, he would c- him and, uh,  I mean, uh,  I don't know, he he
kind of picked apart Edwards


 Ivan 
Mhm.


 John 
and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all
the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial
lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies
and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of
them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you


 Ivan 
Yeah.  Yeah.


 John 
that I didn't like.  And, I guess I didn't really like that, uh,  uh,
Kerry was, like, changing his story all the time, like, oh, I- -- I
believe in this but,  uh, no I don't but yes I do and,


 Ivan 
Yeah.


 John 
you know.  I'm kind of a cut and dry kind of a guy.


 Ivan 
Yeah.


 John 
If you got an opinion I'd rather just want you to tell me straight up
and not


 Ivan 
Yeah.


 John 
try to beat around the bush to -- get my vote or something like that.


 Ivan 
Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I guess to a certain degree they -- they,  uh, I
guess try to play to the middle and try to -- please as many people as
they can but Kerry was just all over the map.


 John 
Right.
