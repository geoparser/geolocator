4. Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering
his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death
penalty.  Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he's been convicted
of?  If so, what were his motives?  How closely did you follow the
trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial?
What kind of sentencing should Peterson receive?


 Alithia 
Hi.  I'm Alithia.  Um,  uh, Scott Peterson trial.


 A 
((Did you-))


 Alithia 
Ah.


 A 
The only reason I- I, uh, actually picked to do this one is I lived in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:278584" id="Pl-1" latLong="37.485°N 122.235°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Redwood City</PLACE>, so.


 Alithia 
Redwood, where's that?


 A 
Um, it's northern <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-4" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" mod="N" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>.


 Alithia 
Oh.


 A 
Where the trial's at.


 Alithia 
And the trial's there.


 A 
Yes.


 Alithia 
Oh, you pick your own -- you pick your own topic?  Mm.


 A 
No, I just picked it. They just called me and I'm like -- I heard
Scott Peterson and I'm like, yeah, I know what the question's going to
be about.


 Alithia 
Yeah, I heard something about it. I don't know. I- I don't know if
he's- if he's guilty or not. What do you think?


 A 
I think so. I think he got into an argument with her and he pushed
her. And I think she fell and maybe she hit her head or something and
it killed her, so he panicked.


 Alithia 
What about the baby?


 A 
I don't think he -- you know, I thi- I don't know.  I don- eh, you
know, because -- th- well, with the baby and stuff, you know, she was
still pregnant at that time, so.


 Alithia 
Oh.


 A 
You never know.


 Alithia 
Yeah, because I was really -- I wasn't really following it that much
because I was-


 A 
Yeah.


 Alithia 
but -- ((but I'd love to have his hair)) something just came off the ~TV
about the Scott trial.


 A 
Yeah. Where are you at?


 Alithia 
I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780799" id="Pl-7" latLong="34.000°N 81.000°W" state="US-SC" type="CIVIL">South Carolina</PLACE>.


 A 
Oh, okay. Yeah. I live in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:278584" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.485°N 122.235°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Redwood City</PLACE>, which they actually moved the
trial here a couple months into it.  Um, from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:278609" id="Pl-6" latLong="37.639°N 120.996°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Modesto</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-5" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>.


 Alithia 
Oh.


 A 
Where he had committed the murders, so.


 Alithia 
Okay.


 A 
Yeah, we're a pretty small town, so our newspaper covers it a lot.
Still do, I'm kind of sick of hearing about him, but -- e- hopefully
this'll be the end of it.


 Alithia 
Yeah.


 A 
Once they sentence him ((I bet)).


 Alithia 
Yeah.  Hopefully, you know, if he's guilty hopefully, you know, they
find him guilty -- and hopefully they have evidence, you know. Do you
know if they have, like, evidence and,


 A 
Yeah.


 Alithia 
you know, against him or whatever?


 A 
There was so much evidence, you know, it's -- a lot of it couldn't be
used, a lot of it was used in that,  you know, what they used against
him.


 Alithia 
How would -- did they, like, found, like, eh, you know, fingerprints
or whatever?


 A 
Um, no. Um, they brought the boat down, or a duplicate of the boat
to, kind of, you know, get a feel for it but they had to remove it
from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:278584" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.485°N 122.235°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Redwood City</PLACE> because people were putting flowers in it in -- memory
of Laci and, you know, planting flowers around it and stuff, so it was
pretty interesting.


 Alithia 
Oh, yeah, that's cool.  Eh, did you all -- did you all know her, or?


 A 
But I- -- What?


 Alithia 
Did you all know Laci, or?


 A 
Um,  a friend of mine's sister used to work in a maternity wear <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-172" state="US-CA" type="FAC">store</PLACE>
and Laci Peterson, the day before she disappeared, was in her <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-173" state="US-CA" type="FAC">store</PLACE>
maternity shopping.


 Alithia 
Oh.


 A 
So, yeah, it was my friend's sister -- who lives in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:278609" id="Pl-8" latLong="37.639°N 120.996°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Modesto</PLACE>.


 Alithia 
Oh, okay.


 A 
Yeah, so, it kind of hit close to home with her, she's just -- you
know, because she kind of felt like she knew her and


 Alithia 
Right.  Yeah, I think it's very sad,  you know, just hearing about it.


 A 
Yeah, it's -- it's -- a whole long process. They've been at this for
almost three years, so.


 Alithia 
Three years?


 A 
Yeah, it's almost been three years.


 Alithia 
Oh, I thought it was just getting on ~TV over here.


 A 
No.  Yeah, it might be over there, but it's been on here for a long
time.


 Alithia 
So, it must've just went local and then then went national


 A 


 Alithia 
Oh.


 A 
You know, we're close to the trial so of course it's going to be in
the newspaper every single day.  So, it's, you know, and the trial,
the, um,  what is it called, the verdict, was actually read by audio
over the ~TV. So it it's pretty ((depressing))


 Alithia 
Mhm.  Is this the case that's trying to, um,  uh, they're trying to-
to get a new juror?


 A 
Mm,


 Alithia 
Is that -- is that the one where somebody called a news-


 A 
they're trying to get a what?


 Alithia 
a new *jural -- a new dir- -- They did?


 A 
Oh, they already did.  Yes, a long time ago.


 Alithia 
Because somebody had -- called the news people.


 A 
Yep.  They already did, a long time ago, um, actually a couple days
before the verdict was was put on.


 Alithia 
Oh really?


 A 
Yes.


 Alithia 
Because that's what they're still talking about he- in these papers
here.


 A 
Yeah, they did that a while back.


 Alithia 
Oh my goodness.


 A 
So, it's now getting wind to your area.


 Alithia 
So we're- this- we're so late over here.


 A 
You know, we get pretty much the information ((hey, it's mom and,))
hold on.


 Alithia 
Okay.
