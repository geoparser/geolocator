 BEGALA 
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. Maybe it's just me, but I think Michael
Jackson, he's kooky, wacky. Time now for &quot;Fireback,&quot; where our wacky and
kooky fans and friends and critics right in. Don from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:202738" id="Pl-8" latLong="39.739°N 104.984°W" state="US-CO" type="PPL">Denver</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780779" id="Pl-9" latLong="39.000°N 105.500°W" state="US-CO" type="CIVIL">Colorado</PLACE>
writes, &quot;Paul, you keep referencing Halliburton selling equipment to
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>&quot; -- which I do. &quot;I recall, as reported in 'The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-10" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="ROAD">Wall Street</PLACE> Journal,'
that the transactions were legal. Is it possible that the equipment
allowed <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> to produce oil for the Oil for Food program authorized by
the U.N.?&quot; They were legal because Mr. Cheney's company used a loophole.
They went through a foreign subsidiary. But they did enrich Saddam
Hussein and his evil, ruthless regime, and they were immoral. They were
wrong. Dick Cheney should have never profited off of doing business with
Saddam Hussein.


 CARLSON 
I would agree with that. What does that have to do with the war in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>?


 BEGALA 
It means Cheney is a hypocrite. He's trying to lead us into a war against
one of his valued customers.


 CARLSON 
Well it's a complete...

(CROSSTALK)

 CARLSON 
You're attacking the man. That's irrelevant to the argument.


 BEGALA 
I'm attacking his business practices.


 CARLSON 
No, no, you're attacking -- OK great. That's great. But it has nothing to
do whether we should go to war with <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> or not.


 BEGALA 
Well yesterday he was a valued customer, today he's an even villain.

(CROSSTALK)

 CARLSON 
Right. So we're against Dick Cheney, but that doesn't have anything to do
with Saddam Hussein. Chad Hensley, from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1499476" id="Pl-11" latLong="38.846°N 77.307°W" state="US-VA" type="PPL">Fairfax</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-12" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="US-VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE>, writes,
&quot;<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-13" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>, <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-15" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> and <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-17" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">German</PLACE> have all multi-billion dollar oil deals with
Saddam in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. I wonder why they protest the war with <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. It must be
the humanitarian reasons.&quot; Well, Chad, that's what liberals assume. That
<PLACE continent="EU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-19" type="CONTINENT">Europe</PLACE> is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies. It is a
weird assumption, don't you think?


 BEGALA 
As you know, I've never said that.


 CARLSON 
You haven't.


 BEGALA 
I don't believe for a minute that this is a war for oil. I think it's
unwise, it's unjust, it's unwarranted, but I don't think it's about oil.
Now, the reason that <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-14" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>, <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-16" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> and <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-18" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Germany</PLACE> are against war is
because they have democracies. The people are against it. It's called
democracy. Those leaders are reflecting the views of their people.


 CARLSON 
They hate <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE>, Paul.
