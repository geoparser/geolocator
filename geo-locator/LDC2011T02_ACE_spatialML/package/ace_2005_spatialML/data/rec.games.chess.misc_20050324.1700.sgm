 Fischer will not be extradited from <PLACE country="IS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17352216" id="Pl-2" latLong="65.000°N 18.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Iceland</PLACE> 

According to:

    

These treaties are at:

(...):

and

(...)

Article I (from the first .com URL above) states that extradition can
only occur:

    

So, since playing chess in <PLACE comment="serbia and montenegro" country="RS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:29045408" id="Pl-12" latLong="43.750°N 20.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</PLACE> has never been against the law in
<PLACE country="IS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17352216" id="Pl-3" latLong="65.000°N 18.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Iceland</PLACE>, Fischer cannot be extradited to the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> for having done this.

Article V states that:

    

In short, if the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> government dared to submit a request for Fischer's
extradition, the <PLACE country="IS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17352216" id="Pl-4" latLong="65.000°N 18.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Icelandic</PLACE> government would not be in breach of the
treaty if it told the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> government to stick its request up its arse.

(Note: I have not yet found anything on the 1972 treaty mentioned at:
(...) but I think it may be
a red herring since I don't understand how in 1972 a treaty between the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> and <PLACE country="DK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17258977" id="Pl-21" latLong="56.000°N 10.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Denmark</PLACE> could bind <PLACE country="IS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17352216" id="Pl-5" latLong="65.000°N 18.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Iceland</PLACE> which by 1972 was an 'independent' and
'sovereign' country).

However it is possible that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> government gangsters might want to kidnap
Fischer in <PLACE country="IS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17352216" id="Pl-6" latLong="65.000°N 18.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Iceland</PLACE> and bundle him to the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-18" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> <PLACE id="Pl-279" type="FAC">base</PLACE> at <PLACE country="IS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17351701" id="Pl-25" latLong="64.017°N 22.567°W" state="2" type="PPLA">Keflavik</PLACE>, so I hope
he employs good security.

You have to laugh at how the '<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-22" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> Times' sneers at <PLACE country="IS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17352216" id="Pl-8" latLong="65.000°N 18.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Iceland</PLACE> as
'<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780786" id="Pl-23" latLong="37.500°N 85.250°W" predicative="true" state="KY" type="CIVIL">Kentucky</PLACE>-sized' and 'windswept':

Why don't they say what they mean, and call it a shitty little rock in
the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:29123050" id="P-281" latLong="40.0 -40.0" type="WATER">North Atlantic</PLACE> that doesn't even have its own army?

They don't seem to be able to bring themselves to report the *truth*,
namely that the <PLACE country="IS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17352216" id="Pl-9" latLong="65.000°N 18.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Icelandic</PLACE> government has had the courage to support a
man in his 60s whom the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> criminal regime is persecuting and seeking to
jail for up to 10 years for the 'crime' of playing chess thousands of
miles away from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> territory.

I doubt that <PLACE country="IS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17352216" id="Pl-11" latLong="65.000°N 18.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Iceland</PLACE> would have offered citizenship to Fischer if they
intended to later honor an extradition request.

The next question is whether <PLACE continent="NA" country="US" form="NAM" gazref="igdb:532871" id="P-280" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> will even bother tendering an
extradition request or not.

    

This is extremely unlikely.
