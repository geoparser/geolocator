Gmail: Cachet for Everybody!

<TEXT>

At first, I was pretty skeptical of Gmail -- an announcement of
something new, cool, and free, from a quirky company, on April Fool's
Day? Turns out my initial attitude wasn't justified, of course, and
Gmail has been a popular success. Just this weekend, Google gave many
users another fifty invitations , prompting some to speculate that it
could be the start of Gmail's final move out of beta. Their marketing
was absolutely brilliant: Simply through association with Google, and
because of the invitation-only membership, they created a product with
instant cachet -- something so in demand invitations went for $50 on
eBay, and one enterprising site even offered a kidney for an invite. And
now? Everyone who wants a Gmail account has one, and yet people with
invites have an almost pathological desire to give them away. It's been
nearly a year, the service is nearly ubiquitous, and somehow Google has
kept us obsessed with Gmail.

Want an invite? I've got a dozen.
