Acceptance of Terror

Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM
and the UN, even the leftist countries in <PLACE continent="EU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-1" type="CONTINENT">Europe</PLACE>, are basically
accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political
party:

On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and
<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-2" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE> , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in
the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections . <SIGNAL id="S-1">To the north</SIGNAL> in
<PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Lebanon</PLACE>, there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the
<PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Lebanese</PLACE> political process in light of <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-3" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE>'s promised withdrawal.
<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-4" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE> has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC
Resolution 1559 , which has already begun . UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has indicated it is time to &quot;recognize Hezbollah&quot; after easily
being duped by &quot;the message on the placards they are using&quot;. This
acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements
is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media. Over three
years after 9-11, the United Nations, despite their attempts to project
strength in fighting terrorism , still cannot properly define the word
&quot;terrorist&quot; , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent
civilians are terrorist acts. The media routinely obscures the lines
between terrorism and legitimate resistance, as the recent article by
Daniel Okrent of The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-8" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> Times demonstrates .

...

The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid
confrontation does not bring peace, but only delays the eventual
conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent
weakness of the internationals and the media. I've been fuming over this
fact for a few weeks now, ever since some organizations and governments
suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in
running <PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Lebanon</PLACE>. Wtf is this? This is a terrorist organization plain and
simple. This is the organization that bombed our Marine <PLACE continent="AI" country="LB" form="NAM" id="P-9" type="FAC">barracks</PLACE> in
1983, took Americans hostage throughout the 80's and now they should be
considered a legitimate organization?

This is just another reason to never trust the MSM, and certainly not
the Europeans.
