Board Member Compensation

 Board Member Compensation 

Hello all,

What is the recommended policy on compensating board members for attending
meetings, when they have no vacation time left at work, and are attending
the board meeting on their own time, without pay. We don't want to lose the
contributions of this board member, but this has become a financial issue.
Thanks.

If your organization is a charity, it is generally considered to be
inappropriate, and in some jurisdictions, it is illegal to compensate board
members for their service. You should check out the law in your state and/or
country.

It is reasonable, however, to reimburse board members for legitimate and
necessary expenses incurred in order to serve on the board. I wonder if
you could make a case for paying someone to replace the board member so the
board member can attend meetings. I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me to be
similar to reimbursing a board member for a babysitter, which no one
questions.

Another possibility is to change the meeting times.

 Re: Board Member Compensation 

We are incorporated in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-1" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="MD" type="CIVIL">Maryland</PLACE>. There are just 5 of us on the board (we
are a charity 501(c)(3), although we all live in different states from coast
to coast. It is very difficult to find times for all of us to get together.
Would I need to check the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-2" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="MD" type="CIVIL">Maryland</PLACE> law or the law in the state in which this
board member lives?

Thanks.

In IRS Publication 557, the sample draft articles of incorporation
indicate that NO compensation may be paid to directors. In
fairness, reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses on behalf of the
organization -- including travel and lodging to attend board
meetings -- are allowed. However, Publication 557 does not
explicitly prohibit compensation to directors.

As far as state laws go, you must follow the laws for the states
(1) in which the organization is incorporated and (2) in which the
organization operates. For an organization that is incorporated in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-3" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="MD" type="CIVIL">Maryland</PLACE> and has its headquarters in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-4" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="MD" type="CIVIL">Maryland</PLACE>, the laws of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-5" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="MD" type="CIVIL">Maryland</PLACE>
apply without regard to the states in which the directors live.
Remember, a corporation is legally a &quot;person&quot;, distinct from the
corporeal persons who govern, manage, and operate the corporation.
Thus, the laws applying to the corporate person are the laws of the
state where that person &quot;lives&quot;.

 Re: Board Member Compensation 

It is very legal, and an acceptable policy or practice in <PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-6" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Canada</PLACE> to pay an
honorarium or stipent for people on boards that are active. Many do this,
as they know it is an investment for the time and talents they need.

They also know, as do the recipients, the payment is but a percentage of the
true worth of the time and effort, but does show respect for what they are
recieving.

 Re: Board Member Compensation 

Is there anyone who knows of a precedent for this being done for a
non-profit in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>?

Thanks!

Yes. Some Head Start agencies, Community Health Centers, and similar nonprofit
organizations serving low-income people have a requirement for &quot;consumer&quot;
representation on their boards. Transportation cost reimbursement, child care
accommodation, provision of meals, etc., can be done either in-kind or in cash.

 Re: Board Member Compensation 

Actually, it would not be advisable to accept Freddy's comments at face
value. It is not acceptable policy and not legal to pay an honorarium or
stipend to directors of charities. I checked with a lawyer familiar with
<PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-14" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Canadian</PLACE> charity law, who explained that it is not permitted to remunerate
board members of charities for their service as board members. The
prohibition does not apply to directors of nonprofit organizations that are
not charities.

In the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">USA</PLACE>, the rules vary from state to state. Some states permit board
members of charities to be compensated, but it is generally not done.
Donors, funders, and the general public share the view that directors of
charities should act gratuitiously. It is permitted everywhere, however, to
reimburse directors for necessary expenses incurred in order to serve. If
your organization is a charity, you need to check your state law and act
very carefully if you are considering paying board members.

Being someone that works and lives in <PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-15" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Canada</PLACE>, and in the non-profit
industry, it is done, and it is very legal.

Take a look at any of the large student unions, they all pay their elected
board members an honorarium, as do many of the large foundations.

It is legal, and it is done.
