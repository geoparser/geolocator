It's now just one day until I hop in the car and head back in time to
the loveliest village on the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-130" state="US-AL" type="RGN">Plains</PLACE>...<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-1" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-21" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE>.

I haven't been back since 1994 and when I was talking to my wife
about the trip this morning, it seems like a lifetime ago. Hell, it's
been half my life since I was in school there and over two thirds of my
adult life, assuming that people that know me think my adult life has
actually started yet.

Anyway, enough nostalgia from me, at least for now.

The wife and I were watching SportsCenter this morning, and Lee
Corso, Mark May and Trev Alberts were ALL picking <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-20" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> to beat
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-23" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL">Georgia</PLACE>, and the last two were picking them to run the table for the
right to play USC for the national championship.

Then, I open the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:352615" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.749°N 84.388°W" state="US-GA" type="PPLA">Atlanta</PLACE> paper this morning, and EVERYTHING is
pro-UGA. I mean, I knew it would be, but some of it was even based on
facts.

Like this beauty: When <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-2" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> and their opponent are both in the top
ten, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-3" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> is 4-6-1 in those games. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-4" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> has lost the last three
games that fit that scenario.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-5" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>'s last defeat came at the hands of...UGA.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-6" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> does lead the overall record in the series 51-46-8. However,
the road team's record in this series. AT <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-7" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>, UGA is 11-8-2. At
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:355407" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.961°N 83.378°W" state="US-GA" type="PPL">Athens</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-8" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> is 17-8. This trend was serious in the 80's, with the
road team winning about two-thirds of the time. The only time this
changed recently really was when UGA decided to win in their place in
2003. Thanks Dawgs.

On the upside, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-9" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> has scored at least 33 points in the last six
games. That's a pretty nice run.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-10" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> leads the SEC in scoring offense, scoring defense and rushing
defense.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-11" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> is second in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-28" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE> in scoring defense and seventh in pass
defense.

Jason Campbell is 3rd in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-29" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE> in passing efficiency while David
Greene is 10th.

Here are a couple of middle of the road stats:

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-12" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>'s Quentin Groves and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-24" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL">Georgia</PLACE>'s David Pollack are tied for the
SEC sack lead.

Here's the biggest for what it's worth stat as far as I am concerned:
both teams are undefeated this year when scoring first. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-13" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> is 8-0
and UGA is 5-0. I'd say that's the biggest stat right now.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-14" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>'s offense is potent and efficient. UGA's defense is relentless
and contains a couple of the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-30" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s biggest hitters, especially Greg
Blue and Odell Thurman.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-15" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>'s defense is fast and relentless and the DB's are experienced
and big. UGA's receivers are leaders, with one of them a team captain.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-16" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>'s two running backs are seniors and very experienced and
dangerous, bruising backs. UGA's two backs are smaller freshmen with
less experience, but are dangerous as well.

In my mind, the game is going to turn on a few key points, some
obvious and some not. Here goes the prediction machine:

- Turnovers (as always) will be critical.

- Special teams play and lack of special teams mistakes will tell the
tale regarding field position.

- Both teams MUST establish the run to be successful. If <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-17" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> goes
for 150 between their two backs, they're almost impossible to beat.
Conversely, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-25" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL">Georgia</PLACE> MUST be able to run the ball to set up play action
and keep the pressure off of David Greene.

- Mark Richt has proven to be a better on the fly adjustment coach
that Tommy Tuberville. Tubs is famous for taking chances, often
unnecessary ones. That history is of concern to me. While it's okay to
try crazy shit when your team is under-rated or a serious underdog, it's
important not to give games away when you're the favorite. Playing more
&quot;by the book&quot; and a bit &quot;closer to the vest&quot; becomes the call for the
day.

Considering all of these factors, I truly believe that this is
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-18" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>'s year. They may not go undefeated and they may not get into the
BCS title game, but they have enough talent, poise and experience to win
this game.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> wins 31-21.

And now that I have typed that prediction, I may just throw up in my
mouth.
