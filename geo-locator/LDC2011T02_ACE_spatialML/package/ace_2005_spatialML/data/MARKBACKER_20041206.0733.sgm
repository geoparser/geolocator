Hey, look who got screwed...

I am having a difficult time putting my feelings into words right
now, so bear with me.

First of all, I want to congratulate the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-1" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> Football team for
doing what no other <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-2" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> football team has done; going 12-0. They also
won their first outright SEC title since 1987 and won their first SEC
title since the conference implimented the Championship game format.

A year ago, the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorly
executed plane trip away from being fired by an over-zealous and too
empowered booster with a fat checkbook. Since that day, the team is
undefeated and has won 14 games in a row. They have now beated four
teams that were in the top 15 at the time the games were played, and two
of those games were won away from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-51" state="US-AL" type="FAC">Jordan-Hare Stadium</PLACE>.

On championship weekend, the big three all played. USC won by five
over a shitty UCLA team with a 6-5 record, and that was thanks in part
to an official who blew dead a clear and obvious fumble that would have
been returned for a UCLA touchdown.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1103857" id="Pl-12" latLong="35.500°N 97.500°W" state="US-OK" type="CIVIL">Oklahoma</PLACE> played in it's conference title game against a four-loss
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780779" id="Pl-15" latLong="39.000°N 105.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-CO" type="CIVIL">Colorado</PLACE> team that can't throw the ball. The result was a 40 plus point
beatdown, but what did anyone expect?

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-3" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> played 15th ranked <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1326873" id="Pl-17" latLong="35.750°N 86.250°W" state="US-TN" type="CIVIL">Tennessee</PLACE> and was attempting to do one of
the toughest things to do in college football: beating a team twice in
the same year.

With the exception of a 15 yard shanked punt and a punt snap that
Kody Bliss missed while having an apparent thrombosis, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-4" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> led 21-7
at the half and had held UT to 46 yards of offense. While the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-5" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>
running game was held up, Jason Campbell threw it all over the ball
<PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-52" type="FAC">field</PLACE> and, when his receivers were covered, he ran for yardage on his
own. This despite several late hits to the head, low hits at his knees
and ankles, and various other assaults outside the realm of good
sportsmanship.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1326873" id="Pl-18" latLong="35.750°N 86.250°W" state="US-TN" type="CIVIL">Tennessee</PLACE> scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled a
touchdown, since the ball clearly touched the turf, and that's where the
momentum of the game changed. I think it was also at that point that the
scoreboard began to reflect <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-6" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>'s last title hopes dying as the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1103857" id="Pl-13" latLong="35.500°N 97.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-OK" type="CIVIL">Oklahoma</PLACE>-<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780779" id="Pl-16" latLong="39.000°N 105.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-CO" type="CIVIL">Colorado</PLACE> score would have begun showing the beat-down that was
occuring.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-7" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> was tied 21-21 and in jeapordy of losing it most important
game ever, but senior QB Jason Campbell would have none of it.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-8" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> won going away 38-28, and the only place the game looked close
was on the scoreboard.

I can't believe that an undefeated SEC team is not playing for a
title, but I guess we can thank Jeff Sagarin and the other dicks that
keep voting USC number one to make up for what happened to them last
year. All I know is that they better think that way next year, because
it's <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-9" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> that got screwed this year.

And what's better is that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-10" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> gets to play one of the three
hottest teams in the country in my opinion. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-21" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> Tech is talented,
very athletic and one of the most well coached teams in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> and
they WILL come to play on January 3rd.

I hope our kids can shake off this travesty and focus on making the
pollsters look like idiots. Maybe an <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1103857" id="Pl-14" latLong="35.500°N 97.500°W" state="US-OK" type="CIVIL">Oklahoma</PLACE> win in a butt-ugly game
and a great <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-11" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> performance could help.

What's the definition of pragmatic? Going undefeated and chanting
&quot;We're number TWO!!&quot;
