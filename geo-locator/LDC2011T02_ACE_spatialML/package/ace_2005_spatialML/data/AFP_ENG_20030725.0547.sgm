<PLACE country="UZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420628" id="Pl-10" latLong="41.317°N 69.250°E" state="TK" type="PPLC">TASHKENT</PLACE>, July 25 (AFP)

The United Nations Human Rights Committee on Friday strongly
criticised <PLACE country="UZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420359" id="Pl-2" latLong="41.000°N 64.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</PLACE>'s execution of six people whose cases were
awaiting the committee's consideration.

The <PLACE country="CH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17447849" id="Pl-11" latLong="46.200°N 6.167°E" state="GE" type="PPLA">Geneva</PLACE>-based committee said it &quot;deplored&quot; the <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-12">Central Asian</PLACE>
ex-Soviet republic's recent execution of Muzaffar Mirzaev, Shukrat
Andasbaev, Ulugbek Eshov, Ilkhon Babadzhanov, Maksud Ismailov and
Azamat Uteev.

The committee urged <PLACE country="UZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420359" id="Pl-3" latLong="41.000°N 64.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</PLACE> to refrain from executing other
prisoners whose appeals to the committee are pending and &quot;reminded&quot;
<PLACE country="UZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420359" id="Pl-4" latLong="41.000°N 64.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</PLACE> &quot;that it amounts to a grave breach (of UN protocol) to
execute an individual whose case is pending,&quot; the statement said.

In a statement, the acting High Commissioner for Human Rights
Bertrand Ramcharan said he deeply regretted the executions.

&quot;These executions render futile (the) review by the Human Rights
Committee of these cases, which amount to a grave breach of
<PLACE country="UZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420359" id="Pl-5" latLong="41.000°N 64.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</PLACE>'s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights,&quot; the statement said.

In early July Amnesty International highlighted the case of Mirzaev,
29, who it said had been executed secretly in June &quot;despite
allegations that he was mentally ill.&quot;

Friday's statement by the UN human rights committee follows raised
international attention to human rights abuses by <PLACE country="UZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420359" id="Pl-6" latLong="41.000°N 64.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</PLACE>, which
under hardline President Islam Karimov has been a key supporter of
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>-led anti-terrorism efforts centred on neighbouring <PLACE country="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420628" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 65.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</PLACE>.

Visiting <PLACE country="UZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420359" id="Pl-7" latLong="41.000°N 64.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</PLACE> in December, the United Nations' rapporteur on
torture Theo van Boven said that torture by the <PLACE country="UZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420359" id="Pl-9" latLong="41.000°N 64.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Uzbek</PLACE> security forces
appeared to be &quot;systematic&quot;.

Critics have charged that Karimov's rule may actually encourage
Muslims to carry out extremist acts as there is virtually no legal
way for them to express dissent.

Activists put the number of political and religious prisoners in
<PLACE country="UZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17420359" id="Pl-8" latLong="41.000°N 64.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</PLACE> as high as 6,500.
