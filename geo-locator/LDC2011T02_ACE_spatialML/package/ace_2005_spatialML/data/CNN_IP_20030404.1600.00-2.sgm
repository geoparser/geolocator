A few miles further to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-32" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE>, <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-24" predicative="true" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> militia and their flags speeding to

After a day of fighting, the Iraqis
were driven back five kilometers, <SIGNAL id="S-1">about three miles</SIGNAL> down the main <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-38" type="ROAD">road</PLACE>
<SIGNAL id="S-2">west</SIGNAL> towards <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-33" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE> from the <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-25" predicative="true" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> city of <PLACE country="IQ" gazref="IGDB:16893567" id="Pl-37" latLong="36.190°N 44.009°E" state="AR" type="PPLA">Erbil</PLACE>. Soldiers were <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-26" predicative="true" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE>,
but the special forces calling in air strikes on <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> positions were
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE>. As <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-18" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> warplanes dropped bombs near the <PLACE country="IQ" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-39" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">town</PLACE>, <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-27" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> fighters
moved forward. (on camera): There's a slow-and-steady battle going on
here for control of the key bridge. It's a bridge over the <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-41" type="WATER">river</PLACE> on the
main <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-40" type="ROAD">road</PLACE> to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-34" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE>. The Iraqis are firing artillery like that in response
to the Americans are calling in air strikes. The Peshmerga are just down
the road, and the Iraqis have retreated, but they're still holding on to
the bridge. (voice-over): That blast turned out to be a rocket-propelled
grenade, but there's plenty of artillery and mortar fire to come.

 ARRAF 
Less than 20 minutes later, with <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> defenses pounded by the bombing,
they no longer held the bridge over the <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-42" type="WATER">Khoser River</PLACE>. In this vehicle,
the only <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> casualties we saw. Their military radio and guns
indicating they were combatants. (on camera): It's still smoldering, this
truck with three <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> soldiers. It was either shelled or bombed. Now,
it's a small part of this battle for the bridge just behind us. These
were lying on the ground next to the truck. Somebody picked them up. It's
an I.D. card, presumably for one of the soldiers. The only thing you can
really tell from it is that he was 27 years old. And a snapshot from when
his life was still ahead of him. Other evidence of a hurried retreat amid
the smoldering vehicles, a discarded gas mask. Military documents.
Notebooks with verses from the Koran. <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-28" predicative="true" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> fighters planted their flag
and left it waving in the smoke of the bombed-out <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> truck. The

poster of Saddam Hussein. Not just the poster, but the frame and
cardboard backing as well. They've been waiting a long time. Jane Arraf,
CNN, on the bridge over the <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-44" type="WATER">Khoser River</PLACE> in northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

 BLITZER 
Thanks very much. Judy, dangerous assignment for all of our reporters,
our embedded journalists. And one of them, not from our CNN, but from a
very close friend of all of ours, Michael Kelly, paid that price. The
first <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> embedded journalist to have gotten killed in covering this
war. We'll have more on him at 5:00 on our special edition of &quot;WOLF
BLITZER REPORTS.&quot; Until then, thanks, Judy, back to you.


 WOODRUFF 
Thanks, Wolf. And we'll be watching. Michael Kelly, of course, with
&quot;<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493680" id="Pl-45" latLong="10.000°N 25.000°W" type="WATER">Atlantic</PLACE> Monthly,&quot; and a columnist for the &quot;<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-46" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> Post.&quot; Well, at
least three <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> service members were killed today in an apparent suicide
bomb attack at a checkpoint near the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16894456" id="Pl-48" latLong="34.140°N 42.378°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Haditah</PLACE> Dam northwest of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.
Those deaths are not yet included in the official casualty count. At last
report, though, 41 Americans had been killed by hostile forces, 13 others
by friendly fire or in accidents. Of the 27 <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-50" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> troops, in all who
have been killed, at least 19 of them were said to be victims of friendly
fire or accidents. The official <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> casualty figures remain the same
this day, including more than 400 civilians killed, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> authorities
say. And <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Central Command says more than 4,000 Iraqis have been
captured, but <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-51" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> officials believe that figure is much higher. We
know that seven Americans are known to be held as prisoner of war in
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. Another 15 Americans listed as missing in action. Well, funeral
services were held today in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780779" id="Pl-52" latLong="39.000°N 105.500°W" state="CO" type="CIVIL">Colorado</PLACE> for 21-year- old Marine Corporal
Randall Kent Rosacker. He was killed in action in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. His story is
especially poignant. His father is a navy commander. He received word of
his son's death within hours after the submarine that he was assigned to
returned home from an extended deployment. The Iraqis promise an
unconventional attack on <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops tonight. Do they mean guerilla
warfare, as in <PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-53" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Vietnam</PLACE>? We're going to ask our military analyst. That's
coming up.
