 WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR 
Hi, Judy. Thank you very much. As of an hour or so ago, we got word from
the battlefield that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces were <SIGNAL id="S-1">just 15 miles</SIGNAL> away from the
southern edge of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-33" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="S" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. And they may be even closer right now. The
toughest fight, though, may lie ahead in the heart of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>.
Pentagon sources say the first phase of the final push into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> is
now under way. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>-led forces were able to press farther north after
defeating <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> Republican Guard units at <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923" id="Pl-34" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="IQ-KA" type="PPLA">Karbala</PLACE> and <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897407" id="Pl-38" latLong="32.498°N 45.829°E" state="IQ-WA" type="PPLA">Kut</PLACE> (ph). Our
embedded reporters say the two-pronged advance appears to be moving
faster than commanders expected. The Pentagon says two of the Republican
Guard divisions defending <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> are no longer credible forces. Scenes

initially were cautious when <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces arrived in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-40" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="IQ-NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE> ended cheering
them on, shaking their hands and patting their backs. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Army's 7th
Cavalry is in the forefront of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops since they first left <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-41" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>
and crossed directly into the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> desert. Our Walter Rodgers is

Division's march toward the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>.

 WALTER RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT 
Throughout the day, as the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Army 7th Cavalry punched <SIGNAL id="S-6">northward</SIGNAL> in the
general direction of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, we have seen huge convoys of supply troops
moving ever northward. Indeed, all the arrows on the Army's map seem to
be pointing in the direction of the southern suburbs of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. Earlier
in the day, the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923" id="Pl-35" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="IQ-KA" type="PPLA">Karbala</PLACE>
with a minimum of fight. And then the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry
Division secured the town of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923" id="Pl-36" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="IQ-KA" type="PPLA">Karbala</PLACE>. Additionally, the 7th Cavalry has
pushed onward in the general direction of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. Yesterday we were
<SIGNAL id="S-2">about 50 miles</SIGNAL> from the southern suburbs of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="S" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. We have perhaps have
that distance. Throughout the day, we have watched the 3rd Infantry
Division bring in prisoners of war. <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> soldiers glad the war is over
for them, perhaps 100 at a time. There were times when the 7th Cavalry
itself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the
direction of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. There was a bit of a firefight when the 7th Cavalry
came upon three Soviet vintage 20- millimeter anti-aircraft guns, ack-ack
guns. The <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> unit in possession of those guns fired mortars in the
direction of the 7th Cavalry. The Apache troop opened its tank guns,
opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and
probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process. This as it continues to
push ever closer towards the southern suburbs of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. Walter Rodgers,
CNN, with the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> 7th Cavalry in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-42" type="RGN">desert</PLACE>.

And it's a similar story from CNN's Karl Penhaul who is now <SIGNAL id="S-3">just miles</SIGNAL>
from the southern outskirts of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="S" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>. He's embedded with the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Army's 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment. Here's his report just filed
a few minutes ago.

 KARL PENHAUL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) 
The speed as they push to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> seems to have gathered pace overnight
and in the course of this morning. In fact, it's going much faster than
many of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> commanders on the ground predicted.


 CAPT. BRIAN MCCORT, PILOT 
The intensity it's very quick moving, very fluid battle. The armor, and
mechanized infantry, and artillery pieces and personnel on the ground are
moving at rapid speeds.


 PENHAUL 
Overnight and early this morning, the tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles
of the 3rd Infantry Division backed by the Apache attack helicopters of
the 11th Aviation Regiment punched through the Republican Guard defenses
in and around <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923" id="Pl-37" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="IQ-KA" type="PPLA">Karbala</PLACE>. They were then able to advance <SIGNAL id="S-4">far north</SIGNAL> of that

Infantry Division are now literally just a <SIGNAL id="S-5">few miles</SIGNAL> from <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-31" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.
