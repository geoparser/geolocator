Here's my second morning NPR post in a row ... Mickey Kaus in Slate
was listening: Here's how NPR's All Things Considered covered President
Bush's proposed cuts in Community Development Block Grants --by lobbing
softballs to a CDBG supporter! No opposing view. ... This is not just
liberal, but dumb liberal--NPR could easily have found a Democrat, maybe
even an old Democrat, who believed CDBGs are an ineffective antipoverty
program. (Basically they are slush funds for local politicians, who too
often sluice the federal money to their developer friends to build ugly
downtown hotels.) It's my sense that in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="US-VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE>, the CDBG program is
used extensively in rural areas and, on the whole, has done some good.
Maybe someone knows of CDBG funds used in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="US-VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> as Mickey describes.
I hope not, but, if so, it looks like there won't be as much of that in
the future.
