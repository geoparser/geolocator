The FTC has issued an injunction against Blockbuster to halt their
attempted buyout of Movie Gallery , which shouldn't surprise anyone. Of
course, how it's anticompetitive for the members of a dying corner of a
vibrant industry to hook up is beyond me: Clearly, among all the
alternative sources for films, movie rental stores are on the way out.
I'm tempted to predict that this will all be rendered moot, either by a
higher bid from Movie Gallery or by the industry changing fast enough
that nobody cares.*

*And TheStreet.com has a dyslexic price for Movie Gallery -- it's
$23.46, no $26.43

Full Disclosure: If only their quotes were right. I own shares of
Movie Gallery.
