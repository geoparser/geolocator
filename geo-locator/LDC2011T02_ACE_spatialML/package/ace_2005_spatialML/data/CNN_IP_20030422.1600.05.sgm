Incest, Other Crimes

(MARKET UPDATE)

 WOODRUFF 
And this final story: retired Senator Strom Thurmond has never made a
secret about his fondness for young, pretty women. So some think
Thurmond's travel plans in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780799" id="Pl-1" latLong="34.000°N 81.000°W" state="SC" type="CIVIL">South Carolina</PLACE> next month are rather fitting.
He'll fly to his first public appearance since returning to his home
state aboard the private jet of a Hooters Air executive. Hooters Air is a
spin-off of a restaurant chain known for its scantily clad waitresses.
But a local Republican official insists there will not be any Hooters
girls onboard with the 100-year-old Thurmond. Smiles. That's it for
INSIDE POLITICS. I'm Judy Woodruff. Thanks for joining us.
