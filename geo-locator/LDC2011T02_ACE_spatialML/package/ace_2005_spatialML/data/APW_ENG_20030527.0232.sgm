opponents and hardline allies.

Sharon's remarks and <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-12" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>'s conditional acceptance Sunday of the

<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-69" predicative="true" type="RGN">Mideast</PLACE> peace negotiations.

A summit between Sharon and his <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-33" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> counterpart, Mahmoud
Abbas, had been planned for Wednesday but was postponed, according to

delay. The officials said no new date had been set; <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-14" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> Radio said
the meeting would take place Thursday.

A three-way summit with <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> President George W. Bush could take

hospital officials said. The army said troops fired, and hit a boy,
after a <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-37" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> youth threw a molotov cocktail.

troops opened fire on youths throwing stones, hitting a 9-year-old
<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-38" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> boy in the head and critically wounding him, and hitting
two 12-year-old boys in the legs, lightly wounding them, <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-39" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE>
hospital officials said. A 10-year-old boy was struck in the leg by a
rubber bullet, but was not seriously hurt, the officials said.

Military sources said troops were trying to break up stone-throwing
protests, but did not use live fire. The army was not aware of any
injuries.

Five <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-40" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> children, a <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-41" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> woman and a police officer,

The
children found the explosives in two plastic bags under a tree and
accidentally detonated the first bag. After a police officer arrived,
the second bag exploded, seriously injuring him, the officials said.

Also Monday, <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-18" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> soldiers fired on four diplomatic vehicles in

<PLACE continent="EU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-82" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">European</PLACE> Union.

Military sources said the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-19" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> army had established roadblocks at
the entrance to <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" id="Pl-83" state="PS-GZ" type="PPL">Beit Hanoun</PLACE> to prevent Palestinians militants from
leaving the <PLACE country="PS" form="NOM" id="Pl-84" state="PS-GZ" type="RGN">area</PLACE>. The sources said shots had been fired in the air
when vehicles tried to skirt the roadblocks.

The violence erupted after Sharon endured withering criticism Monday
from members of his own Likud Party over his Cabinet's acceptance of
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>-backed ``road map'' peace plan.

Sharon indicated a 180-degree turnaround after decades of warning
that an <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-20" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> withdrawal from even small parts of the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-55" state="PS-WB" type="RGN">West Bank</PLACE>
could endanger <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-21" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>'s existence.

Skeptics, however, wondered whether Sharon's conversion was a shrewd
effort to deflect <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> pressure in the hopes the road map would fail
before <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-22" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> had to make tough concessions.

``To keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us and
them,'' Sharon said in remarks broadcast on <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-23" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> Radio.

The term ``occupation'' is anathema to the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-24" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> right, which
believes <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-25" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> has a legitimate claim to the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-56" state="PS-WB" type="RGN">West Bank</PLACE> and <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-62" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="PS-GZ" type="RGN">Gaza
Strip</PLACE> for religious and security reasons.

Palestinians and their dovish <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-26" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> allies routinely use the word
``occupation'' when demanding that <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-27" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> leave the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-57" state="PS-WB" type="RGN">West Bank</PLACE> and
<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-63" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="PS-GZ" type="RGN">Gaza</PLACE> and dismantle Jewish settlements.

Palestinians claim all of the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-58" state="PS-WB" type="RGN">West Bank</PLACE> and <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-64" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="PS-GZ" type="RGN">Gaza</PLACE> for a state.

On Sunday, Sharon's Cabinet conditionally approved the ``road map,''
a three-phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and envisages
a <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-46" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> state in the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-59" state="PS-WB" type="RGN">West Bank</PLACE> and <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-65" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="PS-GZ" type="RGN">Gaza Strip</PLACE> in 2005.

Sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political
solution to the conflict, including an <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-28" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> withdrawal from <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-85" state="PS-WE" type="RGN">West
Bank</PLACE> population centers.

``This can't continue endlessly. Do you want to remain forever in
<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" id="Pl-88" state="PS-WB" type="PPL">Ramallah</PLACE>, <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19205326" id="Pl-87" latLong="32.456°N 35.296°E" state="PS-WB" type="PPL">Jenin</PLACE>, <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19204425" id="Pl-86" latLong="32.221°N 35.254°E" state="PS-WB" type="PPL">Nablus</PLACE>?'' he asked.

Likud lawmakers charged that the road map was slanted in favor of the
Palestinians and endangers <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-29" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>.

In his remarks Monday, Sharon left himself an out.

``What will happen if <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-47" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> terror continues? Nothing. Nothing
will happen. The Palestinians will get nothing,'' he said.

Critics have said Sharon's long-held condition that all violence must
stop before peace moves is unrealistic and guarantees failure of any
peace initiative, including the road map, thus releasing him from the
necessity of following through on his remarks.

Liberal lawmaker Yossi Sarid argued Sharon was trying to keep his
intentions murky to persuade the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> government that he was
committed to the plan, while his hawkish allies could assume he was
just making a tactical move to end <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> pressure.

``Ariel Sharon likes to walk in the fog, because then no one knows
where he is headed,'' Sarid wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
