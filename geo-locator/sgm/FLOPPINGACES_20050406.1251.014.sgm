The Corrupt UN

<TEXT>

Another reason why this organization should be dismantled: (hat tip
The Captain )

The United Nations says it is looking into allegations that a UN
document contained false information that caused instability in war-torn
central <PLACE continent="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30002777" id="Pl-1" mod="CENTRAL" type="CONTINENT">Africa</PLACE>.

A former UN employee, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> intelligence analyst William
Church, told the BBC the details were added to a public UN report by
other UN staff.

The report stated <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-6" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Rwanda</PLACE> mounted a military incursion against
neighbouring <PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-10" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Democratic Republic of Congo</PLACE> last year.

This false allegation endangered the peace process in <PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-11" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY">DR Congo</PLACE>, he
says.

The stakes could not be higher.

The war in <PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-12" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY">DR Congo</PLACE>, which has spread throughout central <PLACE continent="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30002777" id="Pl-2" mod="CENTRAL" type="CONTINENT">Africa</PLACE>, is
one of the deadliest of our generation.

Over the past decade, four million people have died as a result of
it.

The UN has now imposed an arms embargo on <PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-13" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY">DR Congo</PLACE>.

A UN panel investigating that embargo reported in January that <PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-14" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY">DR
Congo</PLACE>'s neighbour, <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-7" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Rwanda</PLACE>, had violated it by mounting a military
incursion.

But a dissenting member of the UN panel, William Church, has now told
the BBC that the <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-8" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Rwandan</PLACE> invasion was a false claim added by other panel
members who had come under pressure from un-named sources.

The chair of the UN investigation, the <PLACE country="DZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20336619" id="Pl-15" latLong="28.000°N 3.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Algerian</PLACE> diplomat Abdulahi
Baali, has told the BBC that he is now looking into what he called
&quot;serious allegations&quot;.

All this matters because the UN has been entrusted with trying to
bring peace to central <PLACE continent="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30002777" id="Pl-3" mod="CENTRAL" type="CONTINENT">Africa</PLACE>.

If there are disputes between UN employees about something as basic
as one country invading another, that trust may be brought into
question. The <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Rwanda</PLACE> invasion became the catalyst for the UN to remain
there and eventually exploit the young girls for prostitution. If this
invasion turns out to be fake then it could turn out to be another
reason why this corrupt organization should be dismantled top to bottom
and thrown in the sewer.

UPDATE 4/9/05 2030HRS

Received the following today from an Anonymous user:

This is an update from William Church.

I have reviewed my analysis with the governments of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-17" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">UK</PLACE> <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> EU and
<PLACE country="NL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17850115" id="Pl-18" latLong="52.500°N 5.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Netherlands</PLACE> and received comments like the evidence is credible.

I alerted the UN of this problem two months before the report was
published. They did nothing to vet the report.

The UN is now responding with a slander campaign against me. One
journalist told me they labeled me a troublemaker and said I was only
doing this because I did not like the Experts and there was no proof.

The UN has no intention of investigating this claim. They are betting
it will die down and it will be business as usual.

wchurch@sms.intranets.com Since it was sent from an anonymous user I
am uncertain if this is a comment from William himself or someone
reporting it to me....be that it may, its interesting information.
