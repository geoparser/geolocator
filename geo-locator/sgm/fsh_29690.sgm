12. Crime: Have you or someone you know ever been the victim of a
crime?  If so, describe what happened.  What kinds of crimes do you
worry about in your hometown?  Are there any places you avoid because
of the high crime rate?  What do you think authorities should do to
make your hometown a safer place?


 B 
I have a cousin uh, he's on death row.


 A 
Oh.


 B 
Because um -- what had happened was he he he was selling drugs for a
long time and he u- he finally decided to stop.  But he had a few --
he had kids.  So Christmas time roll around so it had to be.  It was
around this time of year that when it happened.


 A 
Right.


 B 
So he went out and because he was trying to dri- you know you driving
a cab or whatever to make money but you know that money wasn't nowhere
as fast as what he was doing.


 A 
Right.


 B 
Anyway, he decides all right I'm going to do this one thing. I'm going
to go rob a uh -- he went to rob a laundromat for whatever reason.


 A 
Oh.


 B 
Winds up shooting a man in the <PLACE country="US" id="P-33" type="FAC">laundromat</PLACE>. uh What had happened they
were tussling and he had a gun that w- w- w- -- it was a big
gun. Instead of him -- he didn't go in there with the intent to kill
the man. I I do I do believe that because I know my cousin.


 A 
Right. Right.


 B 
But I do think that he went in there to scare him.  But instead h-
you know he didn't have the gun loaded.


 A 
He's on death row for one person?


 B 
Huh?


 A 
He's on death row for one person? Shooting one person?


 B 
Yeah. Well because of what they said because in the midst of the
tussle, the gun went off and shot the man in the back of the head.


 A 
Uh what race was the man he shot?


 B 
The man was white.


 A 
What race is your cousin?


 B 
He's black.


 A 
Oh, I'm afraid that sounds like...


 B 
Yeah, that's a f- you know that was -- that wasn't a...


 A 
Yeah. I study... Uh I'm um I um a I'm a counselor.


 B 
Mhm.


 A 
And a therapist, you know, and I I I research murders and stuff and
for years. And that that doesn't sound right for him to be on death row
for that.


 B 
Yeah, it was like -- but like I said they -- 


 A 
No.


 B 
What they said was uh -- you know -- if you shoot a person in the back
it's like well they didn't have a chance to defend themselves they
kind of.


 A 
Right. Scott Peterson shot you know Scott Peterson?


 B 
Uh-huh


 A 
But he shot Laci and course she was eight months pregnant with
Conner. Now I can see sending him to death row.


 B 
Uh-huh.


 A 
But I don't see -- uh, I'm afraid it was some racial something in
there too.


 B 
Yeah, it it may have been.  But I m- I mean my thing is...


 A 
Yeah. We have a lot of that here around this <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-1" type="RGN">area</PLACE>.


 B 
Oh okay.


 A 
Yeah, cause you're blacks and it's not right.


 B 
Uh-huh


 A 
A gi- black girl was sh- killed by, suppose she had a white boyfriend.


 B 
uh-huh


 A 
The father of her baby and um he's still not in jail for it.  And uh
they have gotten if in h- her parents have done everything they've
known to try to get -- they're trying to get another trial. I don't
know if they will or not. He's in jail for something else right now.


 B 
uh-huh


 A 
But not for killing her.


 B 
Mm. Yeah.


 A 
And that's not right. I don't care what color. It doesn't matter. But
I don't see him being on death row, that's that you know.  That's sad.


 B 
If if I mean if if it's weird the way you know different places
determine --


 A 
And his family's got to suffer for that.


 B 
Yeah, I mean it's like wh- what can you say like I said, it happened
and you know I don't --


 A 
Has he appealed it?


 B 
I don't think. Yeah he appealed it a few times now cause it's --


 A 
Oh me.


 B 
He he's been -- it's two thousand four. He's probably been in jail for
about nine years now maybe.


 A 
Oh wow, maybe they won't -- maybe somehow they'll get it where he
won't be executed.


 B 
Yeah because that's the thing. Up here people are on death row for
long periods of time.


 A 
Well that's good. I'd hate to see that.


 B 
Oh.


 A 
 Because I know that was wrong what he did.


 B 
Mhm.


 A 
And we should pay the price.


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
But I don't see -- No.


 B 
Yeah, so I mean th- stuff like that happens but I I don't I don't see
I mean -- that's what I was asking you was the the type of crime. Like
up here I would say a lot of it has to do with money.  Getting money
for.


 A 
Right, we have some that. We have burglaries and stuff.


 B 
Mhm.


 A 
But the murders we have are mostly from more the passion or anger.


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
Right.


 B 
Now see, up here a lot of people get shot or or robbed or whatever a
lot of crime has to do like I said with people getting killed.


 A 
Right.


 B 
Uh not uh maybe a year ago a boy was shot in the back over a
basketball jersey that he was wearing.


 A 
Oh.


 B 
He was shot and paralyzed.


 A 
I guess you can tell I am white.


 B 
You know. uh Yeah.


 A 
Yeah, but I'm going to tell you uh you know I'm for justice for
whatever, but that is really bad when they go shoot somebody for a
basketball jersey.


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
I'm not kidding they get killed for their shoes in the cities and
stuff and stuff.


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
And that just that just breaks my heart.


 B 
You know, so...


 A 
But uh we shoul- but you know uh, I meant whatever our crime
rate. Whatever he has to do for the -- we have a lot of Mexicans here
in this <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-2" type="CIVIL">county</PLACE> too and we have blacks course, you know, and whites and
a lot of and whatever we ha- it should be fair for everybody.


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
It should. And it should be, but it's not.  You know I guess you can
tell that. um I'm for fairness in everything.


 B 
Uh-huh


 A 
Yeah. And uh.


 B 
Yeah, it's uh that's what -- but that's what it would boil down to. I
think we need to -- uh if the economy was ever to get straightened out
you know and the job rate, the unemployment rate would go down, you
would see things stop but the way things are going it's like.


 A 
Oh I know. We just had a big plant close down here.


 B 
Oh, yeah.


 A 
And that's really going to hurt.


 B 
Well up here we already had one of the highest uh public
transportation prices in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.


 A 
Oh.


 B 
And in the middle, in the middle of January now uh they're going to
lay off fourteen hundred people and they're going to raise the price
to three dollars for a one way trip on the bus.
