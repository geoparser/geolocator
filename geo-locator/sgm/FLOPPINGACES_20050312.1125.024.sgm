A True Hero - Sgt Kasal Part III

<TEXT>

Got a few updates on this story. First off Senor Lechero (a friend of
his) has a post up about the injuries Sgt Kasal sustained and his
recovery:

The injuries to 1st Sgt Kasal's right leg were severe. 5 or 6 rounds
from an AK-47 completely shattered (read destroyed, obliterated,
disintegrated) both bones about 6&quot; below his knee. The doctor's at
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-1" type="PPL">Bethesda</PLACE> were able to save his leg and set him on a course for recovery.
That course consists of an incredibly painful devise (&quot;far more painful
than being shot&quot;) which is &quot;transporting&quot; his leg bone. In a previous
update I said his leg was being &quot;stretched&quot;, but that is not entirely
correct. What is happening is this...... 1st Sgt Kasal's leg bones were
sawed in half, in two locations (above and below the injury). The two
sections of leg bone are being transported by an &quot;Excursion&quot; devise
which has screws that actually move the bones inside Brad's leg. The
device consists of 4 halos, and 16 pins, some 1/4&quot; thick, protruding
through his skin and muscle into his bones. The transporting which is
taking place is closing the gap from the original injury while widening
the gap from the doctor created injuries, which are filling in with
naturally regenerating bone. This is being done to get his leg ready for
a bone graft surgery. He still has a little over an inch to go, which
will take a month or more to accomplish.

The doctors expect Brad to walk again, but not run. Brad
says......&quot;If I can walk, I'll run:&quot; I for one believe Brad. The
doctor's can diagnose a body's condition, but not a man's will. 1st Sgt
Kasal is a man of extremely strong willpower, and I'm betting on him
being able to run again someday, and pass the Corp's PFT (physical
fitness test)

The story of how 1st Sgt. Kasal was injured is very interesting, and
someday it will be told in it's entirety. Brad told me that he went into
that building &quot;because his marines were in there&quot;. One of &quot;his marines&quot;
was Sgt. Norwood , whom President Bush honored at the State of the Union
Address. Sgt. Norwood was killed in that building where such incredible
damage was done to 1st. Sgt Kasal, PFC Nicoll, and 6 other brave <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
marines. Also, NPR has some audio interviews with the photographer of
the famous picture and more.

And finally Lisa Hoffman wrote a excellent article entitled &quot;Roster
of American Combat Heroes in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> is Rich&quot; which detailes a bit about
Sgt Kasal and Sgt Peralta, whom I have blogged about extensively:

Though most have won little note outside their own units and
hometowns, dozens of GIs - many brand-new to adulthood - have
distinguished themselves with extraordinary valor in what for many were
their last moments of life. One was Sgt. Rafael Peralta, 25, of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1662377" id="Pl-6" latLong="32.715°N 117.156°W" state="CA" type="PPL">San
Diego</PLACE>, a <PLACE country="MX" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18316662" id="Pl-7" latLong="23.000°N 102.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Mexican</PLACE> immigrant who joined the Marines the day after he got
his &quot;green card.&quot; A platoon scout who didn't have to go on the dangerous
Nov. 15 mission, Peralta volunteered to join a &quot;stack&quot; of five Marines
hunting insurgents house-to-house in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Fallujah</PLACE>. Three enemy fighters
waited behind a closed door. When Peralta opened it, he was hit in the
head and chest by a close-up fusillade of AK-47 fire. His Marine mates
fought on, until one of the insurgents rolled a grenade toward Peralta,
who lay bleeding on the floor. To save his nearby comrades, Peralta
reached for the explosive and tucked it under his stomach, where it
exploded. He was the only Marine to die. &quot;This champion of men made the
split-second decision to sacrifice his life for his men,&quot; Julie Snyder,
a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1532910" id="Pl-8" latLong="47.913°N 122.097°W" state="WA" type="PPL">Snohomish</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-9" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">Wash.</PLACE>, mother of a Marine saved that day, wrote in an
online tribute to Peralta. &quot;The words don't exist to describe what's in
my heart for this man.&quot;

...

So did 1st Sgt. Brad Kasal, 38, who led a half-dozen Marines into an
insurgent-held house in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL">Fallujah</PLACE> in November last year to rescue three
wounded leathernecks trapped inside. When the mission was over, Kasal
had been shot seven times and punctured by 40 pieces of shrapnel, which
he absorbed when he used his body to shelter an injured comrade from an
enemy grenade. Kasal survived, as did all but one of the other Marines.
