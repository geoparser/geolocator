From the Associated Press : A baby girl who had been cut out of her
mother's womb was found after a frantic search, and authorities arrested
the woman they say strangled the mother and stole the child. The baby
was in good condition Saturday.

Lisa M. Montgomery, 36, of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:478555" id="Pl-3" latLong="38.507°N 95.638°W" state="US-KS" type="PPL">Melvern</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:482813" id="Pl-1" latLong="38.500°N 98.500°W" state="US-KS" type="CIVIL">Kan.</PLACE>, was arrested later Friday
and charged with kidnapping resulting in death. Bobbie Jo Stinnett, 23,
was found Thursday in a pool of blood inside her small white <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-115" state="US-MO" type="FAC">home</PLACE> in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:727506" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.289°N 95.081°W" state="US-MO" type="PPL">Skidmore</PLACE>, a <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:727506" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.289°N 95.081°W" state="US-MO" type="PPL">town</PLACE> in northwest <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780791" id="Pl-6" latLong="38.250°N 92.500°W" mod="NW" state="US-MO" type="CIVIL">Missouri</PLACE>.

Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, had earlier been talking
with her mother on the phone, and hung up saying a woman she had chatted
with online had just arrived at her door, authorities said.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Attorney Todd Graves said Montgomery contacted Stinnett through
an online message board, and authorities zeroed in on her using computer
forensics. Montgomery was seeking to buy a dog from Stinnett, who raised
rat terriers, he said.

According to the criminal complaint, Montgomery traveled about 40
miles to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:486477" id="Pl-4" latLong="39.048°N 95.678°W" state="US-KS" type="PPLA">Topeka</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:482813" id="Pl-2" latLong="38.500°N 98.500°W" state="US-KS" type="CIVIL">Kan.</PLACE>, on Thursday to go shopping. Her husband received
a call from her saying she had gone into labor and given birth. The next
day, authorities say, Montgomery confessed that she strangled Stinnett
from behind, cut her open, removed the baby and cut her umbilical cord.
I don't understand how we can call this fetus-thing that was ripped from
a mother's womb a &quot;child&quot; or &quot;girl&quot; in a society that sanctions
partial-birth abortion. If you can't charge someone for killing a fetus
via abortion during the eighth month, then surely you can't make a big
deal about a woman who kidnapped a fetus that survived the knifing.

On a less-sarcastic note, I pray for the family of the 23-year-old
woman. No one should have to die because some crazy nut wanted a child
and decided to kill for it. If there's any good news in this story, it's
that Victoria Jo will live on and carry her mother's memory. Question
for the pro-choicers: Being that it isn't yet the ninth month, can we
still charge the killer with kidnapping?
