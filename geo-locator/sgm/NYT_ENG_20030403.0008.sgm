miles from Saddam Hussein's <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-35" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>. Bet`fow Central Command chief
Gen. Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _
whether to rush into the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-55" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> of 5 million where Hussein's regime has
gathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the war can be
won without paying the price of street-to-street urban fighting.

``We are expectingn or at least planning for, a very difficult fight
ahead,'' Gen. Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday. ``We
are not expecting to drive into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> suddenly and seize it.''

Instead of an all-out assault, analysts expect the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> to
follow the example of <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-36" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces outside the southern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-56" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>
of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-37" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="BA" type="PPL">Basra</PLACE>. They are likely to mount small probing patrols into the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-42" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> to determine the level of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> resistance.

If these patrols meet little opposition, thousands of troops could
rush into the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-38" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>. If the Iraqis respond forcefully, the Army and
Marine units could withdraw and await the 4th Mechanized Infantry
Division, which will soon start moving north from <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-39" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>. While they
wait, the forces would try to determine where <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> strong points are
within the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-40" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> and where Hussein might be, if he is still alive.

``The <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-41" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" predicative="true" state="BA" type="PPL">Basra</PLACE> model will work for a while, at least until you see
problems with food and water for civilians in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-43" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>,'' said
Lawrence Korb, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who was
assistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan.

``Before going in (with a full assault), you have to decide if it's
worth the risks, and ... you have to know who's there in the way of
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians,'' he
said.

The administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
civilians, which makes the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-44" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> experience around <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-45" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="BA" type="PPL">Basra</PLACE>
instructive, the analysts said. The <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-46" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> have been outside the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-47" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> of 1.5 million for more than a week. Thousands of refugees have
fled the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-49" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>, apparently providing information to the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-50" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> that
has led to raids on military and Baath Party sites in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-48" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>.

``The key endgame may be whether the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> can parse out the key
regime centers of power in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and attack them without having to
fight into the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-51" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>, or at least locate them well enough to atman of
the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily
war report.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> strategists say that Hussein, if he is still alive and in
control of his forces, might like a bloody battle in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> because
such fighting could cause heavy <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> casualties. His last hope for
survival might be that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> loses its taste for such
losses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would
allow Hussein and his family to keep power in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.

But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-52" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> said
the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive
Hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-57" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>.

``If <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces seriously degrade <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-31" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s half-dozen Republican Guard
divisions before that final battle, and only have to face perhaps
30,000 Special Republican Guard, fedayeen, and related personnel, the
task will not be as hard as it might have been,'' he said.

While two guard divisions have apparently been smashed, there are
three others in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" predicative="true" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> area. A sixth remains in northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-32" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

Cordesman said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units from
the regular <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-33" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> army, which is generally viewed as less reliable.
This shows the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-34" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> military's growing weakness, he said.

``The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammering at every level
and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the
brigade level,'' he said.

The Iraqis still haven't used chemical weapons, even though many
experts feared such attacks as the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops neared <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. Korb,
who's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never
reported to U.N. inspectors, said he wouldn't be surprised if Hussein
tried to use them.

But he also said, ``He may destroy them to embarrass us,'' to show
the world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for no
reason other than aggression.

The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces zeroing in on <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> _ the 1st Marine Division from
the east and the Army's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ are
trained in urban warfare. But in such close-quarters fighting, they
would lose much of the technological advantage of their air
supremacy, which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-58" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>
can cause large civilian casualties.

However, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> from the air looks like <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328" id="Pl-53" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Los Angeles</PLACE> _ wide, straight
boulevards intersected by side streets in a grid pattern. ``Our
forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably. But there
would be lots of casualties on all sides,'' Korb said.
