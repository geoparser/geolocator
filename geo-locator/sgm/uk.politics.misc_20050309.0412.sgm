 Sinn Fein/IRA? 

There are two logical positions to hold on Sinn Fein and the IRA.

1. One accepts Sinn Fein's claim that they are not connected to the
IRA. In that case, there is no point in a <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-1" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> government dealing
with Sinn Fein as the primary conduit to peace because they have no
special influence in the matter.

2. One accepts that Sinn Fein are the IRA. In which case a <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-2" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE>
Government should never deal with them because it means, at the least,
that the likes of Gerry Adams must be guilty of conspiracy to murder,
maim, bomb, rob and extort . Appeasing criminals never works, it
merely puts off the evil day.

The truth is that militant republicanism in Ireland will never accept
disarmament. The names of the organisations may change - IRA, PIRA, Real
IRA etc - but the impulse to terrorist acts will not.

<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493696" id="Pl-4" latLong="54.500°N 7.000°W" type="RGN">Ulster</PLACE> can be contained and managed, that is all at present. One
action which would have a significant effect would be to withdraw all
public provision benefits from militant Republicans -a s they all have
automatic <PLACE country="IE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18496467" id="Pl-6" latLong="53.000°N 8.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Irish</PLACE> citizenship they, they can go the <PLACE country="IE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18496467" id="Pl-5" latLong="53.000°N 8.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Irish Republic</PLACE>. For
more than thirty years the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-3" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> taxpayer has been partially funding
the terror through social security benefit payments - many leading
IRA/Sinn Fein Leaders spent many years on unemployment benefit.

 Re: Sinn Fein/IRA? 

    

I got the impression that there are a number of people in what people
generally describe as &quot;Ireland&quot; who want to have no official link with
the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-7" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">UK</PLACE> or it's government - most of them seem happy to just vote for it,
but some are moved to take up arms to remove what they see as the
interference of a foreign power. Perhaps some members, supporters and
voters of Sinn Fein are also members of the IRA. But it's not as simple
as saying that Sinn Fein is the IRA because it simply isn't true. Gerry
Adams hasn't been convicted of murder, robbery, extortion etc, although
he was once held in prison without a trial, which is an interesting
precursor to the current governments attempts to do away with the Magna
Carta.

    

Many sane people would conclude that there's no need to disarm the IRA
as they appear to be perfectly capable of keeping their word on a
ceasefire while a political path is followed. Surely if they have some
innate desire to kill, maim, bomb etc they've have been doing it
regardless of any political process? To what do you attribute their
current abstinance?

    

Surely if you're a Sinn Fein leader you'd be funded the same as the
leader of any other party?
