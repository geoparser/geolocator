Interview With Ralph Nader, Donald Palmisano; Interview With 
Congressmen J.D. Hayworth, Bernie Sanders

<TEXT>


 BEGALA 
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. President Bush today renewed his call for a
$250,000 cap on pain and suffering damages from the victims of medical
malpractice. Ironically down in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1028616" id="Pl-1" latLong="35.501°N 80.001°W" state="US-NC" type="CIVIL">North Carolina</PLACE> today was also the day
funeral services were held for 17-year-old Jesica Santillan, the brave
young woman who got the wrong heart and lungs in a botched transplant
operation last month. Is her family's pain and suffering only worth
$250,000? Here to debate medical malpractice reform are consumer advocate
Ralph Nader and Dr. Donald Palmisano, the president-elect of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE>
Medical Association.

 NOVAK 
Ralph Nader, there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list by
the AMA where doctors are going out of business because they can't afford
the medical malpractice rates. We'll just run a scroll of some of the
states. They're big states. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-8" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="US-FL" type="CIVIL">Florida</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-14" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="US-NJ" type="CIVIL">New Jersey</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-15" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" state="US-NY" type="CIVIL">New York</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1086497" id="Pl-16" latLong="40.250°N 83.000°W" state="US-OH" type="CIVIL">Ohio</PLACE>,
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780798" id="Pl-17" latLong="40.750°N 77.750°W" state="US-PA" type="CIVIL">Pennsylvania</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-18" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="US-IL" type="CIVIL">Illinois</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-19" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" state="US-TX" type="CIVIL">Texas</PLACE>. This is a real crisis that lawyers have
perpetrated on <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE>, isn't it?


 RALPH NADER, CONSUMER ADVOCATE 
Another one of your leading questions. This is a medical malpractice
crisis. Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day die from medical negligence,
hundred of thousands are injured. And the insurance companies which had
relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its
investment income, its interest income, the stock market collapse down.
And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like
obstetricians and neurosurgeons. But if you take the entire amount of
premiums, Bob, that's paid by doctors in this <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> to malpractice
insurers and divide it evenly, they'd be paying less than $9,000 each.
That's one-third of what they pay a receptionist.


 NOVAK 
That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their
practice because they can't afford it. You know, Ralph, you and I often
agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty
effect of money and politics. Can you say that the lawyers, the trial
lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into Democratic
coffers in order to keep this, do you believe that this is healthy...


 NADER 
Well, as much as they've poured into those coffers, it's much less than
what the doctors, the malpractice insurers, the hospital chains and the
HMOs and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress'
coffers. This is first and foremost, Bob, a question of equity. Are we
going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out
that's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that wasn't indicated that
was inflicted on a woman in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208444574" id="Pl-20" type="RGN">Midwest</PLACE>, or that organ transplant that
was incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1028616" id="Pl-2" latLong="35.501°N 80.001°W" state="US-NC" type="CIVIL">North Carolina</PLACE>. Are we
going to say to these and so many others, you can't have your full day in
court? The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> at the state court level? I haven't yet met one senator or
representative who's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors
in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent,
unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice
cases. And I've never heard one person say that the insurance executives
who make $250,000 a week, every week without any pain and suffering, no
one is saying cap those.

(APPLAUSE)

 BEGALA 
Dr. Palmisano, first thank you for being here.


 DR. DONALD PALMISANO, PRESIDENT-ELECT, AMA 
Thank you. Pleasure to be here.


 BEGALA 
There was a hear on <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:530313" id="Pl-21" latLong="38.889°N 77.001°W" state="US-DC" type="PPL">Capitol Hill</PLACE> today. And, I want to ask you to respond
to one of the witnesses, John McCormick testified today. He's the father
of a little girl, 13-month-old girl, who he said today died because of
medical malpractice. He said that the hospital ignored abnormal CO2
levels in her blood. Said that the attending physician had slept through
several pages. She died awaiting surgery. Listen to what Mr. McCormick
said and I'll ask you to respond.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 JOHN MCCORMICK, FATHER OF MALPRACTICE VICTIM 
Mr. President, from father to father, my family's pain and suffering are
not frivolous.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

 BEGALA 
Isn't he right? Isn't our president wrong to be -- did he win the
Lottery? You know, Mr. Bush -- President Bush says these guys have won
the litigation Lottery. Does that look like a Lottery winner to you,
holding a picture of his dead baby?


 PALMISANO 
Well, the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that
they can't get access to care. The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> Medical Association works
very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system. That's
why we founded the National Patient Safety Foundation. The current system
doesn't measure negligence. It measures disability. And what we're
finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing, trauma centers are
closing, pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boy
knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state. Another
witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no
longer neurosurgeons available in the community. The patient had to be
airavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage.


 BEGALA 
Those are important points, I don't doubt.


 PALMISANO 
Yes.


 BEGALA 
But I wonder if you can respond to Mr. McCormick's point. Who are you,
who's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $250,000
for the loss of a child?


 PALMISANO 
Well, what has to be done here is balance. What we need is a system
that's fair to everyone, a system that keeps the physicians in practice
and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need.
And the system in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-22" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE> that's in the bill, in Congress now, HR-5,
that's a system that has worked. It brought stability to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-23" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE> and
obstetricians in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-24" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE> will pay 55, 57, $60,000 in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328" id="Pl-25" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Los Angeles</PLACE> and
in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-9" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" mod="S" state="US-FL" type="CIVIL">South Florida</PLACE> in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:296004" id="Pl-26" latLong="25.774°N 80.194°W" state="US-FL" type="PPL">Miami</PLACE>, they'll pay $210,000...(CROSSTALK)


 NADER 
Because in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-27" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">California</PLACE> they have regulated the insurance company premium
levels. And in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-10" state="US-FL" type="CIVIL">Florida</PLACE>, they've been very weak on it. And in some states,
for example, there are doctors that are -- you know, there are 45 payouts
in ten years and they're not disciplined by the state medical board. I
mean, you've got 5 percent of the doctors accounting for over 55 percent
of the payoffs, Paul. In other words a small percentage of doctors that
are bad, incompetent, indifferent, whatever. They're not performing
properly and the AMA is not cracking down, is not supporting expansion to
state licensing...

(CROSSTALK)

 PALMISANO 
I want to respond to that. The National Practitioner Data Bank is the
source of the information and it was brought up today. First of all, the
Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used. It lists
multiple claims against one physician when actually it's really one
claim, different insurers pay on the same physician and it's counted as
one claim. It doesn't mention whether they are obstetricians,
neurosurgeons or emergency medicine. It doesn't list that. Right now in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-11" mod="S" state="US-FL" type="CIVIL">South Florida</PLACE>, in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-12" mod="S" state="US-FL" type="CIVIL">South Florida</PLACE>, the latest poll shows that every
neurosurgeon has been sued. The average number of suits against a
neurosurgeon is five in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-13" mod="S" state="US-FL" type="CIVIL">South Florida</PLACE>. Now are these bad doctors? We'll
have no doctors, we'll have no neurosurgeons, no obstetricians...


 NOVAK 
We've got to take a break.


 NADER 
Maybe they are bad doctors.
