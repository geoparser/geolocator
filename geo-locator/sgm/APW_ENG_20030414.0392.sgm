state authorities Monday to start power production at full capacity.

Pavel Pitterman, the spokesman for the State Office for Nuclear
Safety, said his office gave the plant permission to run its second,
newer 1,000-megawatt unit at full capacity. The <PLACE continent="EU" country="CZ" form="NOM" id="P-13" state="JC" type="FAC">plant's</PLACE> first
1,000-megawatt unit has already operated at full capacity during past
tests.

18-month trial production at full capacity at the second unit, needed
to declare the unit ready for commercial production, would start
Friday.

The plant, based on <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-7" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> design and upgraded with <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> technology,
has been plagued by frequent, non-nuclear malfunctions since testing
began in November 2000.

The <PLACE continent="EU" country="CZ" form="NOM" id="P-15" state="JC" type="FAC">plant's</PLACE> first unit, currently shut down for planned maintenance
scheduled to take two months, has already entered the last stage of
tests and should be ready for commercial use at the end of 2003.
