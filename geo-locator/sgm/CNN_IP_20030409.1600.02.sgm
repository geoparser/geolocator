 WOODRUFF 
You are looking at live pictures of the <PLACE id="Pl-137" type="FAC">White House</PLACE> where President Bush
watched some of the television coverage of events in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> today.
Separately, Vice President Cheney shared his thoughts in a speech in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1630985" id="Pl-26" latLong="29.954°N 90.075°W" state="LA" type="PPL">New
Orleans</PLACE>. With me now for more on all this, CNN's senior <PLACE id="Pl-138" type="FAC">White House</PLACE>

correspondent John King. John, they have to be happy there.


 JOHN KING, CNN SNR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT 
Judy, they are. Behind the scenes privately here you get a palpable sense
of vindication, although publicly caution is the watchword here,
administration officials from the vice president on down saying the war
is not over yet. Some of the toughest fighting could still be ahead.
Mostly they believe in those northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> areas Brent Sadler was just
talking about before the break. But they do believe the pictures out of
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> today, on the one hand, send as powerful a message as you can
send to the people in the Arab world who have criticized this war. People
in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> celebrating. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops assisting in pulling down that statue
of Saddam Hussein. Across the Arab world, the administration hopes to
send a signal that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> is there to help the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people
regain control of their own <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, as a liberty, not as any imperial or
occupying force. Of course, at the same time, though, the White House
worries that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> people might see these pictures and think the
war is over. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney among
those saying the toughest fighting might still lie ahead, still
unanswered questions about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein and other
key members of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> leadership. The vice president made that
argument today. But even as he sounds that note of caution, you do sense
a little tiny bit of we told you so.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 DICK CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">UNITED STATES</PLACE> 
Bottom line, with less than half of the ground forces and two-thirds of
the air assets used 12 years ago in Desert Storm, Secretary Rumsfeld and
General Franks have achieved a far more difficult objective. Yet until
this war is fully won, we cannot be overconfident in our position. And we
must not underestimate the desperation of whatever forces remain loyal to
the dictator.

 KING 
We will not hear from the president today, we are told, but before the
week is out and perhaps as early as tomorrow officials say the president
is likely to offer his thoughts on the challenges just ahead. So, again,
behind the scenes, a sense of vindication, but also a cautious attitude
because of the fighting still to come. I have to tell you, though, Judy,
the CIA Director George Tenet walked out of the <PLACE id="Pl-128" type="FAC">White House</PLACE> a short time
ago with a giant smile on his face. I cannot recall a moment since
September 11, 2001 and those tragic events when we have seen the CIA
director look so happy.


 WOODRUFF 
Well, John, given all that you've said, we know that there's an <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE>
retired general waiting in <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-27" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>. But in addition to that, what steps
are they already taking at the <PLACE id="Pl-129" type="FAC">White House</PLACE> to plan for a post-Saddam
Hussein government in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>?


 KING 
They are planning to accelerate that planning process. Jay Garner the
retired general will go into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> soon with his troops soon. I say
troops. They are civilians from the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> government. That will take place
soon. They are awaiting for word from the Pentagon that it believes the
security environment is secure enough for that to happen. And beginning
as early as next week, there will be a series of town meetings, if you
will. The invitations will be issued by General Tommy Franks. They are
trying to identify Iraqis from within the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, as well as <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
dissidents and exiles, the diaspora they call it here at the <PLACE id="Pl-130" type="FAC">White House</PLACE>,
who will be part of a planning process to begin the process -- they say
it could takes weeks or more -- of selecting who should be part of that
interim <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> authority. Now, we know, one person who will be invited is
planning process, those planning meetings, is Ahmed Chalabi. He is the
leader of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> National Congress. He is known to be a favorite of
Vice President Dick Cheney, of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary
Rumsfeld's top deputy, Paul Wolfowitz. He will be involved in the
planning and in those meetings. But I also should report that there is a
sense of annoyance here at the <PLACE id="Pl-131" type="FAC">White House</PLACE>, even among some of Mr.
Chalabi's top supporters, that, since returning to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> in recent days,
he has complained frequently, including on our air earlier today, that
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> is moving too slowly to get in the reconstruction
efforts, to restore electricity and restore water. Over at the Pentagon
today, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, again, a supporter of Mr. Chalabi,
said that, in his view, services were already at their prewar levels. And
Mr. Rumsfeld went on to say, Secretary Rumsfeld went on to say, there is
still a war going on, still quite a dangerous situation -- Judy.


 WOODRUFF 
Yes, we caught some of that irritation in his choice. All right, John
King, our senior <PLACE id="Pl-139" type="FAC">White House</PLACE> correspondent, thank you. Still to come:
warfare amid the celebrations in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. As Iraqis poured into the
<PLACE id="Pl-140" type="FAC">streets</PLACE> to mark their apparent new freedom, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> troops come under
fire from a different area. CNN's Martin Savidge will show us what they
came up against at <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad University</PLACE>.
