Philip Morris looks at some unorthodox expansion tactics

I'm not sure what's more remarkable -- that Philip Morris is buying
an <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17320538" id="Pl-3" latLong="5.000°S 120.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Indonesian</PLACE> tobacco company , or that there are any independent
foreign tobacco companies left. Outside the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>, the business is one of
the best around -- high growth, high cash flow, and thanks to local tax
structures, plenty of government support. Thanks to the stigma of
producing cigarettes, the only acquirers are the folks already in the
business. I'm going to go out on a limb and call the international
tobacco business one of the most lucrative around for the next ten years
-- you just need to sit back and wait for the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> companies to make
an offer, and in the meantime, collect those dividends.
