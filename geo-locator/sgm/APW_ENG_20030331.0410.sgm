<PLACE country="DK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17258977" id="Pl-5" latLong="56.000°N 10.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Denmark</PLACE>'s TV2 reported Monday.

Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of

He was sentenced to four months in
prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10.

TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that
33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately.

Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment.

It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving
his sentence. The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to
drop his appeal.

Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day
suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing
with <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-11" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">German</PLACE> club <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18238049" id="Pl-13" latLong="51.433°N 6.750°E" state="DE-NW" type="PPL">Duisburg</PLACE>.

national team after it was knocked out in the second round of the
