Capital Gains on House after divorce

 Capital Gains on House after divorce 

I and my ex jointly bought the <PLACE country="US" id="Pl-119" state="ca" type="FAC">house</PLACE> in 1998 for $220,000 in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-1" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>. We lived in the <PLACE country="US" id="Pl-120" state="ca" type="FAC">house</PLACE> since then. We started
divorce proceedings in 2004 and my wife moved out. Current
value of the house is 540,000.

I had to pay her, by refinancing my mortgage, half the
current property value minus loan remaining which came to
about 200,000. i.e [ (540k - 140k)/2 ] . She did not pay any
taxes for that.

Now I understand if I sell the <PLACE country="US" id="Pl-121" state="ca" type="FAC">house</PLACE> I am stuck with a
capital gains tax as a single person on the entire gain !!!
i.e 540k-220k = 320 K as the limit is only 250K ?

This does not look fair, as my cost basis should be
readjusted when I paid my ex half the value 200K !!!
My real gain is much less.

Any comments ??

 Re: Capital Gains on House after divorce 

    

Who told you that? Sounds wrong to me: Your cost basis
should be adjusted to reflect the additional $200,000 --
which you paid to your wife, for her share of the <PLACE country="US" id="Pl-115" state="ca" type="FAC">house</PLACE>.


And you should certainly also include the original $110,000
(your share of the $220,000), which means your correct cost
basis is now about $310,000. So if you sell for $540,000,
your gain would be $230,000 -- and therefore free of any tax
obligation, under current law.

Of course, there may be other additions to the cost basis
which you haven't included -- such as significant <PLACE country="US" id="Pl-112" state="ca" type="FAC">home</PLACE>
improvements, like a room addition or remodeling of the
kitchen. Those would also be added into _your_ basis. I've
only dealt with the figures you provided.

 Re: Capital Gains on House after divorce 

    

There are a few WRONG answers being posted on this subject
so I thought I would expand on my original answer and give
the OP some authority.

Under Code Section 1041, any transfer of property between
spouses during marriage or any transfer of property between
former spouses incident to a divorce is treated as a gift.
Because these transfers are treated as gifts, the transferee
spouse may exclude the property received from his gross
income under Code Section 102(a).

The transferee spouse's basis in the property received for
all purposes is the transferor's adjusted basis immediately
before the transfer. Code Section 1041(b)(2). This carryover
basis rule applies whether the adjusted basis of the
transferred property is less than, equal to, or greater than
its fair market value at the time of the transfer,
regardless of the value of any consideration provided by the
transferee, and applies for purposes of determining loss as
well as gain on the subsequent disposition of the property
by the transferee. Reg. Section 1.1041-1T(d),

Code Section 1041 is not elective. It applies whether the
transfer is for relinquishment of marital rights, for cash
or other property, for the assumption of liabilities in
excess of basis, or for other consideration, and is intended
to apply to any indebtedness that is discharged. Reg.
Section 1.1041-1T(d). Even if the transfer is a bona fide
sale, the transferor does not recognize gain or loss, and
the transferee does not acquire a new cost basis in the
transferred property. Reg. Section 1.1041-1T(a) Code Section
1041 applies regardless of whether the transfer is of
property separately owned by the transferor or is a division
(equal or unequal) of community property. Further, Code
Section 1041 applies even if the transferred property is
subject to liabilities that exceed the adjusted basis of the
property. Reg. Section 1.1041-1T(d),

EXAMPLE: Andy owns property having a fair market value of
$10,000 and an adjusted basis of $1,000. In contemplation of
making a transfer incident to a divorce from Becky, Andy
borrows $5,000 from a bank, using the property as security
for the borrowing. Andy then transfers the property to Becky
and Becky assumes, or takes the property subject to, the
liability to pay the $5,000 debt. Under Code Section 1041,
Andy recognizes no gain or loss on the transfer of the
property, and Becky's adjusted basis in the property is
$1,000.

Code Section 1041 also applies to transfers of property
incident to a divorce. Code Section 1041(a)(2). A transfer
of property is incident to a divorce if it occurs within one
year after the date on which the marriage ceases or is
related to the cessation of the marriage. A transfer is
treated as related to the cessation of the marriage if the
transfer is pursuant to a or separation instrument and the
transfer occurs not more than six years after the date on
which the marriage ceases. A divorce or separation
instrument includes a modification or amendment to a decree
or instrument. Reg. Section 1.1041-1T(b)
