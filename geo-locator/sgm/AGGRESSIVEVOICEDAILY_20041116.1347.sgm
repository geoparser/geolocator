From Reuters : <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Marines rallied round a comrade under
investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="IQ-AN" type="PPL">Falluja</PLACE>, saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable,
hair-trigger circumstances.

Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they didn't see the shooting as a
scandal, rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during
the effort to quell the insurgency in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="IQ-AN" type="PPL">city</PLACE>.

&quot;I can see why he would do it. He was probably running around being
shot at for days on end in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="IQ-AN" type="PPL">Falluja</PLACE>. There should be an investigation but
they should look into the circumstances,&quot; said Lance Corporal
Christopher Hanson.

&quot;I would have shot the insurgent too. Two shots to the head,&quot; said
Sergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:30074657" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.441°N 79.996°W" state="US-PA" type="PPL">Pittsburgh</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780798" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.750°N 77.750°W" state="US-PA" type="CIVIL">Pennsylvania</PLACE>. &quot;You can't
trust these people. He should not be investigated. He did nothing
wrong.&quot; Of course the anti-<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> world press is jumping all over this
story, casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in
question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent
that was booby-trapped with explosives.

Add the tactic of booby-trapping your own dead to the effective
suicide bombings, and it's clear to say that the <PLACE country="CH" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:30074657" id="Pl-9" latLong="46.200°N 6.167°E" predicative="true" state="CH-GE" type="PPLA">Geneva</PLACE> Convention isn't
on the minds of the insurgents. For that I believe the Marines should
handle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure
their own safety and prevent a possible ambush. I'm no fan of this war
either, but it irks me to no end reading and listening to civilian
opinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile war zones
from their comfortable recliners.

To the world press and everyone else who despises the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>:
You don't have to like our president or those operating this war, but
get off the backs of the 18, 19 and 20 year-olds thrown into a situation
you will never see or have to encounter. I've got too many friends in
Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will
support them at every opportunity.
