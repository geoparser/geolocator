Daylight Savings Time is retarded

I am 36 years old. I've been around a while. I'm not 87 or anything,
but I've seen some things in my life. I have initially agreed and
disagreed with different things over the years, only to have my mind
changed later. However, I will never EVER change my mind about the
idiocy we call Daylight Savings Time.

I Googled &quot;Daylight Savings Time&quot; and I got the following link:

http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/

I started reading...

The site says things like &quot;We've learned to save energy and enjoy
sunny summer evenings by switching our clocks an hour forward in the
summer&quot; and there's no S at the end of Savings. It should be Daylight
Saving Time.

My apologies to the assclowns that invented this idiocy and the
goobers that perpetuate it in such a ridiculous fashion.

I will concede that &quot;springing forward&quot; and &quot;falling back&quot; are good
ways to remember to change the batteries in your smoke detectors.
However, New Years and the Fourth of July would do the same thing.

I kept reading the website of propoganda and found that the first
person to come up with the idea was Benjamin Franklin who did it on
behalf of some friends that owned oil companies (oil was used in lamps).

I assume that, because the idea was dumb and inconvenient, lots of
people ignored it. &quot;By 1966, some 100 million Americans were observing
DST based on their own local laws and customs. Congress decided to step
in to end the confusion and establish one pattern across the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.
The Uniform Time Act of 1966 (15 <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Code Section 260a) which was
signed into Public Law 89-387 on 12 April 1966, by President Lyndon
Johnson, created Daylight Saving Tim to begin on the last Sunday of
April and to end on the last Sunday of October. Any State that wanted to
be exempt from DST could do so by passing a state law.

There's a LOT more to this since then, and you can read a lot more it
if you want to, but this is what I know:

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:449508" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.000°N 86.250°W" mod="E" state="US-IN" type="CIVIL">Indiana</PLACE>'s eastern half doesn't use it. What's THAT all about?

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-4" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="US-AZ" type="CIVIL">Arizona</PLACE> doesn't use it because one tribe of Indians stretches into
three states. But those other states DO use it.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780782" id="Pl-5" latLong="20.750°N 156.500°W" state="US-HI" type="CIVIL">Hawaii</PLACE> doesn't use it at all. Of course, they're closer to <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-88" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> than
to us, and since <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-7" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> doesn't use it, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780782" id="Pl-6" latLong="20.750°N 156.500°W" state="US-HI" type="CIVIL">Hawaii</PLACE> just plays along. (Do you
think the Hawaiian's sit around, staring west, just becuase they still
don't trust the Japs?)

Regardless of when I go to bed (11pm or 10pm or 9pm), I get up at
5:30 and I am fucking exhausted. How can that be? I slept the same
number of hours as I did two weeks ago, yet I'm tired?

Also, I am so hungry I could eat my little tub of Carmex by 10:30am
every day. I used to eat lunch between 11:30 and noon, but now, eating
is all I think about after 10am. Why is that good for me?

I don't care if <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> saves 1% of its energy consumption costs
during those times. I am tired, hungry, and I leave for work and get
home from work in the dark. How healthy is that?

For that matter, I don't care about any of the pro-farming or
anti-crime propoganda. Daylight SAVINGS Time sucks!!

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go stalk the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-86" type="FAC">lobby</PLACE> for the girls
that are bringing me my Krystals. order and fight to keep myself from
falling asleep in my cube.

About time you realized Daylight SavingS time is the work of Satan's
minions.

You would feel comfortable in <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-9" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE>, then; it's the same time
everywhere.
