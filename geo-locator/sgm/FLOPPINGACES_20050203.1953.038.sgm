Liberal Reporter Taking Kickbacks

Interesting article at the Accuracy In Media website yesterday. It
seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to
fund a book that is so pro-united nations that its almost sickening to
read. (hat tip Clear and Present )

One of the hottest stories around, the U.N. corruption scandal, NBC
has been out to lunch. Why? Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll of
the U.N. lobby. Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and
MSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. ,
which reads like the U.N. paid for it. Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paid
for it. In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news
reporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation and Better
World Campaign for &quot;their generous financial support&quot; of her book
project. She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund &quot;for helping to
fund the project.&quot; The book is about &quot;one of the finest and most
important governing bodies,&quot; she says. Of the U.N. chief, she writes
like a school girl with a crush. &quot;It is hard to find anyone who can
mount a serious criticism of [Kofi] Annan's performance as Secretary
General,&quot; she claims. His performance is so &quot;impressive&quot; that she
wonders if a &quot;cult of personality&quot; has risen up around him. One <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
official is reported to be &quot;astonished by just how good a Secretary
General Kofi Annan has been.&quot; Yup, you read that right. Kofi's
performance is soooooo impressive. Gag. Guess the democrats have their
own Armstrong conspiracy to deal with.

Why would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for National
Public Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby? Perhaps because longtime
NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">USA</PLACE> and
BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership
Dinner. Not surprisingly, Brokaw is listed on the Fasulo book jacket as
saying it is a &quot;must-read.&quot; Another endorsement of the book comes from
Barbara Crossette, former <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> Times bureau chief at the U.N. who
now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that
covers the U.N. A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to
gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-5" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Rwanda</PLACE>. She tries to
blame the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and other members of the Security Council for not sending
enough troops to stop it. She admits, however, that, &quot;The <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-6" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Rwanda</PLACE>
massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for
peacekeeping,&quot; and that &quot;After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan
commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest
remedies.&quot; Later, &quot;Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act more
quickly,&quot; she writes. But responsibility for what? The truth is that, as
director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to
authorize U.N. peacekeepers in <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-7" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Rwanda</PLACE> to seize weapons and prevent
genocide. Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail
how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the
commander of several thousand U.N. troops in <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-8" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Rwanda</PLACE>, sent a fax to Kofi
Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Rwandan</PLACE>
government informant that genocide was being planned. The informant
offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be
used in the genocide campaign. All that the informant wanted in return
was protection for himself and his family. But the general needed U.N.
authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives. He asked for that
approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous &quot;genocide fax&quot; from
Annan's office. It denied authorization for the mission and told him
that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness
over to the <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-10" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Rwandan</PLACE> government which was planning the genocide! The
result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place.
Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to
the very government that was planning the genocide. What a great guy he
is isn't he.

Or how about the ongoing prostitution that's going on in the <PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17794602" id="Pl-13" latLong="1.000°S 15.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Congo</PLACE>?

Now the report comes out today on the Oil for Food scandal.
Yeah...this guy is such a good SG. Eff him.

The article ends with the following:

In an April 30, 2001, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-14" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" predicative="true" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that
the media have devoted &quot;scant mention&quot; to the &quot;plain fact that it was
Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office,
who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their
sympathizers in <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-11" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Rwanda</PLACE> in 1994.&quot; It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N.
issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in
the killings. But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan &quot;refused to
accept any responsibility for the <PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-12" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Rwandan</PLACE> holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch
and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped
the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes.&quot; It is astonishing
that a journalist for NBC New would close her eyes to Annan's role. But
that is what she was apparently paid to do.
