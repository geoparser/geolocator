them. When she's in <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-8" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Germany</PLACE>, Lynch will be treated for bullet wounds and

 GREG LYNCH, JR, JESSICA LYNCH'S BROTHER 
I can't really say how the military is functioning over there because I'm
not there. But they are doing a job, you know, I don't know the thoughts
of the soldiers, the men and women that went into that <PLACE id="Pl-257" type="FAC">building</PLACE> and
brought her out. They are heroes in my book.
