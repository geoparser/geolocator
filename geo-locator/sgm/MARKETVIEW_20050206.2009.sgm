Even more blogospheric M&amp;A?

Frenetic merger and acquisition activity doesn't mean much in the
early days of a business -- it's just as likely that ridiculously
overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create
larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking
visionaries are cutting off their competitors early. But when an
outsider buys into the business once it's established itself as
important, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news. For
now, it's just a rumor that Ask Jeeves is buying Bloglines . I'd keep an
eye on this -- if Ask Jeeves pops on the news, the easy money from the
blogging trend is already gone.

Well said! Like somebody commented on the Napsterization post, 0 + 0
= 0. :-)
