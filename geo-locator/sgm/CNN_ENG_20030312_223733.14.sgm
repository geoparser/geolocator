the morning papers, because morning papers around the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> and
around the world are remaking their front page to include the
elizabeth smart case, and we end with that tonight. with her family on
a day when their miracle finally came true.


she looks very, very healthy. she's grown a lot. and i'm just so
absolutely thrilled. i couldn't believe it. in fact, i had to take a
double take and pull her back away from me and say, &quot;is it really
you?&quot; all of the children out there deserve to come home to their
parents the way -- the way elizabeth has come back to us. and i just
hope and pray that congress will quickly pass the amber alert so that
those children will have a better chance because they cross the state
line and they're out of commission. and we need to have this here. we
really do. but i just am so grateful and so thankful. thank you very
much.


reporter: can you describe elizabeth's demeanor? you said she looked
good, she was bigger, but she's been through this horrible ordeal. is
she still scared? she excited? happy?


i don't know. i mean, it was just -- i'm sure she was just thrilled to
be back. i just -- such happiness and such love. and i just held her,
held her the whole way home.


i just brought her little brother william in. and as william and she
saw each other, it was such a wonderful reunion for them to just hug,
and they -- he would hug her and look at her and hug her and look at
her. and couldn't believe, i think, as a 4-year-old now that his
sister is home.


with the darkness that surrounds us in these times of the possibility
of war that could be coming upon us and a miracle that has been
brought to us, an incredible miracle that has been brought to our
family, words cannot express how grateful we are for the prayers
around the world. do miracles still exist? and the answer is yes. and
we have elizabeth back.
