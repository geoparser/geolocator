 NOVAK 
Welcome back. Orders went out today to deploy 17,000 <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Army soldiers
in the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493586" id="Pl-8" latLong="27.000°N 51.000°E" type="WATER">Persian Gulf</PLACE> region. The army's entire first Calvary division
based at <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-9" state="TX">Fort Hood</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-10" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" state="TX" type="CIVIL">Texas</PLACE>, would join the quarter million <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces
already in the region. We're talking about possibilities of full scale
war with former Congressman Tom Andrews, Democrat of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:580493" id="Pl-11" latLong="46.820°N 67.924°W" state="ME" type="CIVIL">Maine</PLACE>. He's now
national director of Win Without War, and former Congressman Bob Dornan,
Republican of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-12" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>.


 BEGALA 
Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this
war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have
been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration. Our
president has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're aware,
Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> arms
program who defected for a time. And gave us a whole lot of information
and then went home and his father-in-law killed him. Bad move. But while
he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information. Gave us a whole lot
of information. Well, our president told us that information proves that
the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true. But what we just
learned this week from &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine which got a hold of the
debriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995. Why
hasn't our president told us that? Why do we have to learn it from
&quot;Newsweek&quot;?


 DORNAN 
I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed. The fact that this
guy was such an idiot to go back and let his father-in-law kill him shows
he wasn't the most stable of people. But the things that...


 BEGALA 
Good point. But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told
him. Why do we learn from &quot;Newsweek?&quot;Should he level with us?


 DORNAN 
Paul, look, the problem is I would stipulate all four of us hates war.
Any rational person hates war. Bush isn't sitting in that White House not
thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men. Clinton
suffered greatly over the 19 Rangers that died, 18 on the 3rd of October
and Matt Reersen (ph) three days later. I visited all their families. I
was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids. Let me tell you, what
trips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the
law of unintended consequences it pertains to war. I am shook over the
aftermath. But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler. He will blow a
city off the earth in a minute if he can get the hold of the means to do
it.


 NOVAK 
Tom Andrews, I think we all realize that a government doesn't go to war a
nation goes to war. And so I would like you to take a look at the
CNN/&quot;USA TODAY&quot;/Gallup poll, taken last week, should <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops to go to
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Take a look at it. Favor 59%,
opposed 37%, that's a vastly larger support than President Bush Senior
had in getting the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops out of <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-13" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE> before that war started.
That's pretty good support isn't it?


 ANDREWS 
Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this. I mean, listen, this is the
oldest trick in the book. You can have a general question like this that
could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the
top of their head. But, ask them another question, ask them what they
think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy. Ask them
about going and not just a war, Bob, but an invasion and occupying for up
to 10 years a sovereign Arab <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE> in the midst of one of the most
distable and volatile regions in the world. Ask them how they feel about
getting bogged down. Well, I've seen some of the figures. Once you start
telling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell us
story. They're not coming forward and telling us what the risks are, what
the costs are, how many years we might be in, the possibility of us
getting bogged down, because what Americans know that, they're opposed to
this war. The more they learn about this invasion, the more they learn
about this occupation, the less they support it.


 DORNAN 
Tom, you know what liberals want. They don't want a smoking gun, they
want a smoking city. The Clinton people all say...


 BEGALA 
That's going to have to be last war, unfair and unfortunate as that is, I
am sorry, they're telling us we're out of time. Former Congressman, Bob
Dornan from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-14" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>...


 DORNAN 
You're not going to get a smoking city.
