An explosion in a <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-260" type="FAC">cafe</PLACE> at one of the <PLACE country="TR" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19264662" id="Pl-6" latLong="39.927°N 32.864°E" state="TR-06" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>'s busiest intersections
killed one woman and injured another Tuesday, police said.

Police were investigating the cause of the explosion in the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-266" type="FAC">restroom</PLACE>
of the multistory <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-261" type="FAC">Crocodile Cafe</PLACE> in the commercial district of

windows in the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-262" type="FAC">building</PLACE>.

Police recovered the body of a woman from the debris of the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-265" type="FAC">restroom</PLACE>
and carried it away in a bodybag.

News reports suggested that the woman may have been a suicide bomber
or may have died when the bomb she was planting exploded prematurely,
but police and interior ministry officials refused to confirm the
reports.
