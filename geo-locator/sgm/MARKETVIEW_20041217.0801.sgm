Gazprom, the main <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-2" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> gas company, has been denied a $10 billion
credit line due to the political situation in <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-3" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE>. The company
intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos
assets (hence that firm's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know
it's bad when you have to use <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> courts to protect your own assets from

current trends there, they'll just Blame the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208561573" id="Pl-7" type="RGN">West</PLACE> when their screwy plan
screws them over.
