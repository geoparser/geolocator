A retired navy officer facing life in prison over a failed effort to
protect <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" id="P-13" predicative="true" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, told a court Thursday
he felt remorse for his part in the 1999 plot.

``I have a guilty conscience,'' Andonis Naxakis said during his
two-hour testimony.

Naxakis is one of 13 people on trial for bringing the fugitive
guerrilla leader to <PLACE continent="EU" country="GR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20169939" id="P-4" latLong="39.0 22.0" type="COUNTRY">Greece</PLACE>. Ocalan was moved by the government to its
embassy <PLACE continent="AF" country="KE" form="NOM" id="P-6" type="FAC">compound</PLACE> <SIGNAL id="S-1">in</SIGNAL> <PLACE continent="AF" country="KE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17750169" id="P-5" latLong="1.0 38.0" type="COUNTRY">Kenya</PLACE>, where he was captured by <PLACE continent="AI" country="TR" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="P-17" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Turkish</PLACE>
commandos.

The retired <PLACE continent="EU" country="GR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20169939" id="P-12" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Greek</PLACE> officer said he had been trying to get Ocalan to
<PLACE continent="EU" country="NL" form="NAM" gazref="igdb:17850115" id="P-8" type="COUNTRY">The Netherlands</PLACE>, home to a large <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" id="P-16" predicative="true" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> community.

He claimed he had been manipulated by the government.

``I believe I was unwittingly used as bait for its disgraceful plan
... an organized move by the government to hand Ocalan over to
<PLACE continent="AI" country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="P-9" latLong="39.0 35.0" type="COUNTRY">Turkey</PLACE>,'' he said.

Naxakis and two of Ocalan's <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" id="P-15" predicative="true" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> associates are being tried on
criminal charges of endangering national security. Ocalan, being
tried in absentia, was indicted for entering the <PLACE continent="EU" country="GR" form="NOM" gazref="igdb:20169939" id="P-11" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> illegally, a
misdemeanor.

Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, is serving a
life sentence in <PLACE continent="AI" country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="P-10" latLong="39.0 35.0" type="COUNTRY">Turkey</PLACE> for leading a 15-year insurgency against the
country that left 37,000 people dead.

He is being tried in <PLACE continent="EU" country="GR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20169939" id="P-3" latLong="39.0 22.0" type="COUNTRY">Greece</PLACE> in absentia.
