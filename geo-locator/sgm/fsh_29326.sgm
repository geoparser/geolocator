4. Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering
his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death
penalty.  Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he's been convicted
of?  If so, what were his motives?  How closely did you follow the
trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial?
What kind of sentencing should Peterson receive?


 Mohammed 
Hi. Good evening.


 Jean 
Hello.


 Mohammed 
How're you doing?


 Jean 
Good evening. My name is Jean, and I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-1" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="US-AZ" type="CIVIL">Arizona</PLACE>.


 Mohammed 
Oh, from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-2" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="US-AZ" type="CIVIL">Arizona</PLACE>, Jean. How are you doing?


 Jean 
I'm fine, thank you. And what's your name?


 Mohammed 
Ah, this is Mohammed, calling from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-3" state="US-NY">New York</PLACE>.


 Jean 
Mohammed, calling from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-4" state="US-NY">New York</PLACE>. Glad to meet you.  Well, the topic is
interesting, but they've been having this one for three days. I don't
know why they're so obsessed with it.


 Mohammed 
Seems like it's a weekend,  or they want to get as much as they can
feedback from people.


 Jean 
I guess so, Yes.


 Mohammed 
And so what do you think was-


 Jean 
I I didn't actually -- watch the trial very much, uh th- in fact, I
didn't watch the trial at all.


 Mohammed 
Mhm.


 Jean 
I read about it in the newspaper and things like that.  Um,  I do
think from all the, uh, things that I have heard that he -- had to be
guilty with all the evidence that they had, but um,  I don't really
know why, uh,  if everybody was so, sort of, obsessed about it when
we've got so much other -- things going on in the world that, uh, seem
to me much more important, but um.  Perhaps it was because he seemed,
uh, a very human kind of person and, and you cou- you couldn't really
understand why he would want to do something about that. I- I think
his motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend, but uh- -- kill
his own first child that way is extraordinary.  What do you think?
Mohamed?


 Mohammed 
Yeah.


 Jean 
And what do you- What do you think about it?


 Mohammed 
Being very frankly, I was not,  uh, following the case at all even uh
uh television, or uh reading, but from what I can observe,that it
seems, eh, it has been talking -- -- taking too long time.  Like one
year almost, now.  It was-


 Jean 
When you what?


 Mohammed 
It was -- taking so much time. Long time.


 Jean 
Yes.


 Mohammed 
The case is almost one year.  Like last,  uh, Christmas if I'm not,
uh, recalling my memory.  So for one year, it's really a good time.
Hu- So I'm asking myself why it took such a long


 Jean 
Hm.


 Mohammed 
It may be because -- it's quite important,  or so there is so many
everything's, I mean,  it's, it's a really different case.  But,  the
quo- the nice quotient is about the media.  But the media have biased
in this,


 Jean 
Yes.


 Mohammed 
or not?  I believe that media is a very good, uh,  I mean, uh,  way
to give us all the opportunity to understand and see.  I mean without
the media,  you and I, how we will be knowing?


 Jean 
No, exactly.  Do you think they were biased in in -- favor of him, or in
favor


 Mohammed 
I- -- No, I don't think so.


 Jean 
No, I didn't think so either from what I heard.


 Mohammed 
Maybe -- sometimes in- in- in- in other issues they- they may be biased,
but in this issue they were just -- covering what's happening,


 Jean 
Yes.


 Mohammed 
and, uh, they give us the picture. It was a camera -- to give you the
view.  I don't think they were biased in this case here.


 Jean 
Yes.  No.


 Mohammed 
And, uh,  what do you think will happen next?


 Jean 
Well, uh they're coming up to the sentencing, and I heard yesterday or
read in the newspaper or something that his brother -- I guess it was
on the television.  In the news, his brother was appealing -- for them
to to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the death
penalty, because -- he said he's a very good listener and he cares about
people, and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison.  I
don't know whether that is true or not. I know that he had done a lot
of volunteer things before, and that was the one things that made me
wonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebody
else who did it.  I think given such as I have heard, even though like
you, I did not follow the case day by day or anything like that,  I
don't quite see how he could not be guilty if they've got so much that
appears to point to him.  And what would be the motive for anybody
trying to -- to get him if it wasn't


 Mohammed 
Yeah.
