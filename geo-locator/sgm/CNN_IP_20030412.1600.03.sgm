A reminder, Jessica Lynch coming back to the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> within the
hour. Tonight, a special on the rescue of Jessica Lynch. That's at 8:30
p.m. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-25" mod="E" type="COUNTRY">Eastern</PLACE>, 5:30 <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-26" mod="W" type="COUNTRY">Pacific</PLACE>. Well, after many trying months of defending
Saddam Hussein, Ambassador Mohammed Aldouri finally said the game is
over. Now, his tenure at the United Nations is over, too. Last night
before leaving the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>, Aldouri said he hopes to see free
elections in a free <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. CNN's Richard Roth has more on this once
prominent frontman for the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> regime.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) 
The last time <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>'s U.N. ambassador addressed the Security Council, the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> ambassador walked out in protest.


 MOHAMMED ALDOURI, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">IRAQI</PLACE> AMBASSADOR TO U.N. (through translator) 
What happened is that the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> army up until now has not confronted the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> forces.


 ROTH 
But now, it's the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> ambassador's time to leave, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-22" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>.


 ALDOURI 
The game is over. I hope that peace will prevail, and that the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
people at the end of the day will have a peaceful life.


 ROTH 
Mohammed Aldouri spent more years as a university professor than as a
diplomat. In <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-28" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>, he briefed people interested in his <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>,
recently a group of Lehigh University students. But he never got
comfortable in the media glare before and especially during the war.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
You said you weren't...


 ALDOURI 
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) has happened with you? Please, why did you come here?


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Because we thought...


 ALDOURI 
Tomorrow, I will see you in the <PLACE continent="NA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:969243" id="P-139" state="NY" type="FAC">U.N.</PLACE>



 ROTH 
And at the U.N., all ambassadors carry out their instructions whether
they agree with them or not.


 JUAN GABRIEL VALDES, <PLACE country="CL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19123076" id="Pl-31" latLong="30.000°S 71.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">CHILEAN</PLACE> AMBASSADOR TO <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> 
Well, I think that he had a very, very difficult task. He defended the
positions of his <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> with courage, I would say.


 JEREMY GREENSTOCK, <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-32" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">BRITISH</PLACE> AMBASSADOR TO <PLACE continent="NA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:969243" id="P-138" state="NY" type="FAC">U.N.</PLACE> 
He's a decent man, and I hope he finds a decent life representing a
decent government.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Aldouri is a dear friend of mine.


 ROTH 
Aldouri also drew support from opponents of the war a gift of paper
cranes. But on the eve of Aldouri's departure, women representing the
Daughters of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-33" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> Revolution passed by, wanting to let fly with
something else.


 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 
If I had eggs, I would like to throw eggs at him.


 ROTH 
U.N. diplomats don't toss eggs, just nods. Several months ago, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
ambassador, John Negroponte, and the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> ambassador almost locked eyes.
And forget about <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-34" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>.


 MOHAMMED ABULHASAN, <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-35" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">KUWAITI</PLACE> AMBASSADOR TO U.N. 
Nothing.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Not one word?


 ABULHASAN 
Not one word, except a normal greeting of, &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;


 ROTH 
That was as close as residents of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-36" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°We" mod="NE" predicative="true" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>'s Upper East Side district got
to know Aldouri, who kept a low profile, like many in the big <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-38" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°We" state="NY" type="PPL">city</PLACE>. It's
a <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-41" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°We" mod="NE" state="NY" type="PPL">neighborhood</PLACE> you wouldn't expect the diplomatic post of an enemy
government to turn up.


 ALDOURI 
I am very thankful for the people of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-37" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°We" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>, for their generosity. This
is a very decent people. I was really -- without talking about the
problem in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, I was really happy to be here in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-39" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°We" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>, within the
people of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-40" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°We" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>.


 ROTH 
Aldouri was worried most about the people of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.


 ALDOURI 
When I see, what I've seen, what you see, my heart squeezes blood.


 ROTH 
Aldouri was in better spirits as he departed for the <PLACE id="Pl-134" type="FAC">airport</PLACE> with a final
message.


 ALDOURI 
I hope that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> Army will leave <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> soon, and we will have
free election for a free government for a free future for <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> and the
people for <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. This is my message to you, to the people of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" type="COUNTRY">United
States</PLACE>.


 ROTH 
The ambassador's prime concern now: his family in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. One day he hopes
to teach again back home. Richard Roth, CNN, <PLACE continent="NA" country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:969243" id="Pl-137" state="NY" type="FAC">United Nations</PLACE>.

 WOODRUFF 
We'll try to track his progress and see if he's able to do that,
Ambassador Aldouri. Still ahead, looters cast about for new places to
loot, and chaos is king in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-42" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. We'll have a report.
