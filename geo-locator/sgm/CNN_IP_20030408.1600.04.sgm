 WOODRUFF 
Well, the journalists' death raise questions about the tactics of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
troops trying to take control of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20032588" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. They also serve as a reminder
that many of our colleagues covering this war are putting their lives on
the line every day. Some thoughts now on the dangers from our senior
analyst, Jeff Greenfield.

 JEFF GREENFIELD, CNN SR. ANALYST (voice-over) 
When an Al- Jazeera reporter was killed today, the network charged it had
been targeted by <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> force. Central Command said, no, its forces were
trading fire from a hotel where the network was housed. At a nearby
hotel, two other journalists, a photographer from Reuters and another
from Tele 5 <PLACE country="ES" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19596523" id="Pl-15" latLong="40.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Spain</PLACE> died, another case, CENTCOM says, of coalition forces
returning fire. A <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20032588" id="Pl-16" latLong="36.288°N 42.174°E" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> journalist died in a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> friendly-fire
accident in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">north</PLACE>. And an <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> writer/editor, &quot;<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-18" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> Post&quot;
editorial columnist Michael Kelly, was killed when his Humvee plunged
into a canal while evading <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> fire. (on camera): It is an elementary
fact of life during wartime: A press pass provides no protection.
(voice-over): Famed World War II reporter Ernie Pyle was killed by a
sniper on an <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-20" type="RGN">island</PLACE> in the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493588" id="Pl-19" latLong="0.000°N 0.000°E" type="WATER">Pacific</PLACE>. Famed combat photographer Robert
Capa, who took a classic photo of a fighter's death during the <PLACE country="ES" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19596523" id="Pl-21" latLong="40.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Spanish</PLACE>
Civil War, himself died from a land mine in <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208609045" id="Pl-22" type="RGN">Indochina</PLACE>. Sean Flynn, son of
the famous actor Errol Flynn, disappeared in <PLACE country="KH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18976808" id="Pl-24" latLong="13.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Cambodia</PLACE> in 1970. More than
65 journalists of many nationalities died in <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-23" mod="SE" type="CONTINENT">Southeast Asia</PLACE>. ABC News
producer David Kaplan was killed by sniper fire in the <PLACE continent="EU" form="NAM" id="Pl-25" type="RGN">Balkans</PLACE> in 1992.
Sometimes reporters, like &quot;The <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-26" state="NY" type="ROAD">Wall Street</PLACE> Journal&quot;'s Danny Pearl, die in
covering a different kind of war. Pearl was murdered by terrorists in
<PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17229029" id="Pl-27" latLong="30.000°N 70.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Pakistan</PLACE>. The casualty count helps put the ongoing debate about
journalistic neutrality into a sharper light. The 600 journalists
embedded with <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> troops in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> will be threatened by the same fire
as the troops they are covering. Their safety, their lives, may depend on
those troops. Neutrality in a firefight? Not likely. And that raises a
bigger question. Are they supposed to be neutral on the outcome of the
war? In an interview with broadcasting and cable magazine, CBS News
President Andrew Heyward said of the neutrality notion -- quote -- &quot;It's
one of the stupidest things I've ever heard. This story is going to be
told from a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> point of view. We are <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> reporters, the ones with
the troops.&quot; (on camera): Now, none of this means journalists will ignore
unsettling news: military setbacks, lack of supplies, the infliction of
civilian casualties. Reporters who ignore or distort facts are betraying
their craft no matter what and no matter how much that may anger the
people running a war. But whether in the old <PLACE country="OTHER" form="NAM" id="Pl-28" type="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</PLACE> or Nazi <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-29" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Germany</PLACE>
or <PLACE country="ZA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18714703" id="Pl-30" latLong="30.000°S 26.000°E" type="COUNTRY">South Africa</PLACE> or <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, respect for the facts does not require a
reporter to throw his values over the side. Jeff Greenfield, CNN, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-31" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New
York</PLACE>.

will talk to Larry about the death of his colleague and the continuing
plight of journalists in a war zone. That's tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern,
6:00 Pacific. Just now, we want to show you scenes from Andrews Air Force
Base just moments ago, President Bush returning to the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-32" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> from

Tony Blair, the president back on <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> soil after a quick two-day
trip, less than two-day trip to <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17410393" id="Pl-36" latLong="54.583°N 5.933°W" state="NIR" type="PPLA">Belfast</PLACE>, he and the prime minister
discussing, of course, the war in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, what happens after, as well as
the peace process in the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-38" type="RGN">Middle East</PLACE>, and restarting the peace process in

helicopter, heading back to the White House, where he will arrive pretty
soon. Still ahead: How is the world reacting to the war in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>? When we
return, our Richard Quest takes a look. Stay with us.
