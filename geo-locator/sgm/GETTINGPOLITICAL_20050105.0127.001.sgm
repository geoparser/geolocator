Mischie in jail

<TEXT>

Nicolae Mischie, authoritarian leader of a district organization of
the main opposition party, has been jailed.

<PLACE country="RO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20100038" id="Pl-1" latLong="46.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Romania</PLACE> voted in the last December, ousting the so-called socialist
party PSD (Social-Democratic Party). PSD managed to keep a stronghold in
poor rural areas, with the help of people like Mischie. They combined
blackmail, using their right of decision regarding the public funds for
local leaders opposing PSD, and strong seduction of the uneducated
masses, in a marvelous way. E.g., Mischie, who talks like an idiot, got
a PhD in history. His paper was on a political personality of the 19th
century and Mischie bought the <PLACE country="RO" form="NOM" id="Pl-92" type="FAC">house</PLACE> where his paper's subject
lived. Maybe he tried to invest in his paper, maybe he believed
sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his
ability of earning PhDs, but using a big car and living in a big <PLACE country="RO" form="NOM" id="Pl-94" type="FAC">house</PLACE>
are signs for the masses that the man is an invaluable and irreplaceable
leader. Another misleading sign was his position as a University
professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities, which are
still ways to buy diplomas here in <PLACE country="RO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20100038" id="Pl-2" latLong="46.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Romania</PLACE>.

Local leaders did their jobs, but national leaders, pressuring TV
stations to lie, associating with old communist ex-president Ion
Iliescu, failed to win in big cities.

PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going
to elect a leader. It is known that communist leaders die in office (as
judges of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Supreme Court) and Ion Iliescu won't be
different. All the leaders that expressed different points of view will
be excluded from the party, that's the untold truth that <PLACE country="RO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20100038" id="Pl-3" latLong="46.000°N 25.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Romanian</PLACE>
media seem to hide or not conceive yet.

Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders, because PSD got
a good share in the elections in his area. But Mischie was wrong,
because he did that while in vacation in <PLACE country="CH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17445610" id="Pl-5" latLong="47.000°N 8.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Switzerland</PLACE>, where you can't
go if you earn 20K $ a year. The new power had nothing to do,
but let the policemen do what they should be doing years ago.

Iliescu and Nastase, ex-president and ex-prime minister, are now left
only with the leadership of the party and holding this illusory
authority. If Mischie wouldn't take his chance on them, he would
still be free, with the help of the weak and weakening strings Iliescu
might still pull.
