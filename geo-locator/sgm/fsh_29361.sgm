5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in
a <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-1" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" state="FR-75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> <PLACE country="FR" form="NOM" id="Pl-162" state="FR-75" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help or
hurt the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-2" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>-<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-10" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?
What do you think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> policy should be toward <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE> now that Arafat
has died? What, if anything, should the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> do to be involved in the
<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-18" type="RGN">Middle East</PLACE> peace process?


 Ali 
Hi.


 Mark 
I- -- my name is Mark.


 Ali 
My name is Ali,  uh,


 Mark 
How you d-


 Ali 
from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780798" id="Pl-19" latLong="40.750°N 77.750°W" state="US-PA" type="CIVIL">Pennsylvania</PLACE>.


 Mark 
how you doing?


 Ali 
I'm fine.  How are you?


 Mark 
Good, good.  Not too bad.


 Ali 
Uh, so let me ask you, do you think Arafat was, uh, a good leader or
not?


 Mark 
Um,  to hi- -- yeah, I- -- I think he did what he thought -- was right for
his people.  I- I- -- I would say he was a good leader -- for- -- for, uh,
his people.  And as far as our involvement there, should be as little
as possible.  Just let them do -- what they,  you know, what they're
going to do -- and we should stay out of it ((just)) as -- much as we can.
Uh, this country seems to get involved too much in other people's
politics.  Should just let them do whatever they're going to do,


 Ali 
Uh,


 Mark 
you know.


 Ali 
mm, by the way I am from Arab origin,  so I also have, uh,  uh, the
same opinion -- like you.  I believe he -- -- in my opinion he- he was a
good leader -- and, um,  I believe what,  eh, has to be done -- right now
is to ((apply)) -- the United Nations', uh,  decisions about the
conflict between Arab and <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> because there is -- -- there are a lot
of,  uh, decisions have been made -- have been made -- and this, uh-
For example, one of them was, uh, decision number two forty-two -- and
this was about -- the ha- establishing two- two countries,  one for
<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> and another one for <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE>.


 Mark 
Right.


 Ali 
So, if we -- -- eh, if <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" nonLocUse="true" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>,  Bush,  <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> ((told)) th- the
solution or to, uh,  to make the decision,  eh,  I think this will
solve -- the problem.  The -- unfortunately what happens right now- -- The
-- for example, which is -- little bit toward it's- it's interest.  For
example,  when there was, uh, like,  a -- decision against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>,  the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> -- went directly -- to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> to -- -- for, eh,  uh,  an
invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh,  putting
any attention to the United Nations,  uh, like, uh,  approval.  She
did wha- what she want.  But, eh,  eh, for <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>, <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-11" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE>
conflict there's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but until
now -- she didn't put any pressure,  eh,  toward ((this and)) and I
believe this policy has been, uh,  this kind of policy,  eh,  um,  eh,
became more and more during -- eh, during, uh, eh, Bush -- -- President
Bush time.  For example, before, eh, during Clinton,  I believe at
that time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and I
believe at that time, if you remember,  um,  Yasser Arafat -- and, uh,
the prime minister of <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-8" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>, his name was Barak,  they met together
in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532723" id="Pl-161" latLong="38.898°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="FAC">White House</PLACE> -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve
this problem -- and during Clinton, eh,  period -- they had, uh, this
((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement.  Most of the big problems between the two
parties,  they negotiated everything almost and there is -- there
were, like, final steps that have to be solved.  But, uh, I think if
there was, like,  the, um,  the same policy has to be followed after
Clinton.  I think -- everything would- -- -finished then- -- the -- I think
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-22" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> -- went to another direction and, eh,  they forgot about
this problem right now.


 Mark 
Yeah, I g- eh, see, I don't,


 Ali 


 Mark 
um, when- when policy is set by one -- -- by one president -- towards-
towards one thing,  it's usually -- followed through, if there is
something to follow through, by the -- next president in turn. He is
more or less obligated -- to continue,  uh, the process that was already
started -- but -- I think -- Bush's -- agenda -- is not -- towards that right now.
That is not his priority, I don't think.


 Ali 
Yeah, I think so, yes.


 Mark 
And, eh,  uh,  although, you know, it's been a long time -- that -- i-
they have both -- b- both <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-9" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> and <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE>, they both need a -- they
both need their own country -- and-


 Ali 
That's, uh, true because, uh,


 Mark 
an- -- eh, y-


 Ali 
in the United Nations they have established -- eh, they made this
decision already.


 Mark 
R- right, right.


 Ali 
The -- uh, there, uh -- there has to be two countries, one of them for
<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE>,


 Mark 
Right.


 Ali 
and another one for <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> but, uh,


 Mark 
I- I- I agree a hundred percent, uh,


 Ali 
because, eh, i-


 Mark 
eh,  but to get so involved in it. I think,  the people,  uh,  the
people that are in charge, the- eh, the people that run the
governments there -- do need to sit down an- and- and be in touch with
each other and if they need a mediator or something like that, that-


 Ali 
Which is played by U- <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>. This is the mediator which, in my
opinion, is the one


 Mark 
R-


 Ali 
who has the power to convince both -- parties -- about-


 Mark 
Right. Right. Um, i- -- they -- in --


 Ali 


 Mark 
it's a -- -- eh, that i- -- that is what is need and un-


 Ali 


 Mark 
unfortunately they've been -- they've been trying to get this settled
and hashed out for -- twenty-five, thirty years now.


 Ali 
Yeah.


 Mark 
Uh,


 Ali 
Yeah.


 Mark 
i- it's been a long time in coming and anything that's good is worth
waiting for, you know what I mean? Eh, I mean, that's what I've always
been told. And -- but-
