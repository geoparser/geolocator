It ain't much...

Sorry I haven't been posting much lately. We have been so damned busy
with the holidays (that's what we call December at our <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-10" state="US-AK" type="FAC">house</PLACE>) that I
just haven't had time.

I read a funny joke today and I thought I'd share it with you. One of
my fellow eggers posted it, so Chet, here's your credit:

A traveler was driving through <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:69085" id="Pl-1" latLong="34.750°N 92.500°W" state="US-AK" type="CIVIL">Arkansas</PLACE> when he lost his way and got
off the main <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-2" state="US-AK" type="ROAD">highway</PLACE>. As he drove by, he saw rows and rows of pigsties
and pigpens and pigs running in fields and pigs wallowing in mud.
Suddenly, his eye caught something really strange. He did a double take,
muttered to himself and then looked a third time. He wondered if he had
seen correctly - it looked like a pig with a wooden leg! He found the
<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-8" state="US-AK" type="ROAD">lane</PLACE> to the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-3" state="US-AK" type="FAC">farm</PLACE> and drove up into the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-4" state="US-AK" type="FAC">farmyard</PLACE>, where he was met by the
farmer. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; the traveler said. &quot;I was just driving by and
looking at all your pigs, and I noticed something that I just had to
stop and ask about. Tell me, did I see right? Is there really a pig out
there with a wooden leg?&quot; The farmer smiled. &quot;Oh, that would be old
Caesar you saw. He's the finest pig a man could ever hope to have - and
smart! Well, let me tell you a little about that pig. You see that barge
down there on the river? That's a mining dredge, taking out platinum
ore. Old Caesar sniffed out the vein and showed us how to set it up. Now
that dredge brings me in about $120,000 every year. &quot;There's another
thing, too, a little more personal. One night a couple of years ago I
got to drinking and I guess I had more than I should have. I passed out
drunk, fell down and knocked over a lamp. That started a fire in the
<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-7" state="US-AK" type="FAC">house</PLACE> and old Caesar smelled the smoke. He came in the back door, got
the wife and kid out, roused me up and got me out. &quot;There is no question
about it - that night old Caesar saved all our lives and you know that
is not the sort of thing a man is going to forget too easily.&quot; &quot;Why,&quot;
the traveler said, &quot;this is all amazing! I have never heard of a pig
like this before! This is fantastic! But tell me, how did he get that
wooden leg? Was he in a wreck or something?&quot; The farmer laughed and
said, &quot;Well, naturally, when you have a pig that smart, you don't want
to eat him all at one time!&quot;
