4. Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering
his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death
penalty.  Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he's been convicted
of?  If so, what were his motives?  How closely did you follow the
trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial?
What kind of sentencing should Peterson receive?


 Hillary 
Hello.


 Kelly 
Hello?


 Hillary 
Hi, my name is Hillary.


 Kelly 
Hey, hello. My name's Kelly. Could you hold on for a second?


 Hillary 
Sure.


 Kelly 
One, okay.  Hello?


 Hillary 
Mhm.


 Kelly 
Hillary?


 Hillary 
Yeah.


 Kelly 
Hey, yeah, okay.


 Hillary 
It's uh


 Kelly 
So the


 Hillary 
a pretty -- depressing topic for today.


 Kelly 
yeah, I guess so. The truth is I don't really, uh, I don't really know
much about that topic.  I didn't really follow the trial very closely
at all


 Hillary 
we don't have, uh, cable so we purposely didn't watch the trial, but I
read about it on the internet.


 Kelly 
so


 Hillary 
and basically


 Kelly 
Oh, really?


 Hillary 
he -- killed his wife when she was -- eight months pregnant and -- and
dumped her in, uh -- the ocean, basically.


 Kelly 
So why was it so special? Why did that, uh -- particular case make -- the
the national news?


 Hillary 
I think it's because it was in such, it was like a, um


 Kelly 
Like


 Hillary 
it was -- in such a quiet, upscale community where it happened and -- um
just I think the fact of her being eight months pregnant, um, drew a
lot of attention and


 Kelly 
Yeah.


 Hillary 
of course people were worried about her for a long time and then they
found her and blah blah blah. It was -- gossip, basically.


 Kelly 
((Yeah, right.)) Oh, but the mistress had nothing to do with the
murder?


 Hillary 
I think -- yeah, cause he found out, they found out he had a mistress,
and then it was like, oh -- Yeah.  Are -- I don't think, I don't think so,
but who knows? I don't know.


 Kelly 
Right.


 Hillary 
very sad cause she has a child herself and so she drug her son through
a lot of -- uh, drama that he didn't need to be part of.


 Kelly 
Wait, what happened?


 Hillary 
I don't know.  She has a son too, so he he also got put -- um -- you know,
in the spotlight a bit, from what I understand. I didn't, I don't have
TV though, so I don't really know.


 Kelly 
Oh, the son of the, right right.


 Hillary 
of -- of his girlfriend, yeah.


 Kelly 
Yeah.


 Hillary 
I don't know. I hear though, that he's going to be -- the first person
to be (()) um -- uh -- killed for a crime in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-1" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE> in like, thirty
five years or something.  Oh.


 Kelly 
Oh, really?


 Hillary 
I don't know if they've, I don't know if they've -- um -- given him the
death penalty yet. But I think he would be the first in, in a really
long time to actually -- be killed.


 Kelly 
Yeah, that's amazing.


 Hillary 
I don't


 Kelly 
Um -- why, uh, now why did they decide that this was to be this big (())
out of this with the most heinous crime in all of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>?


 Hillary 
well, you know


 Kelly 
I mean I guess that's not how they decide who died, but it's because
of the


 Hillary 
you know, and


 Kelly 
the, uh, cou-, like the -- the court that they went to, like the area
doesn't


 Hillary 
well, I don't know why they decided on this, I think it was because it
was so public of a case.  But they have a lot of


 Kelly 
Yeah.


 Hillary 
they have many many worse crimes going on in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>, parents
killing their children and everything, that you would think -- would
would, um -- you know, be


 Kelly 
Hearing more.


 Hillary 
be more


 Kelly 
Stringent penalties,


 Hillary 
yeah, but they don't, they ignore those because this one got on
television, I guess.


 Kelly 
keep like -- uh, the jury from watching ~TV and the media and stuff.
But I guess now ((it's, uh)) -- pretty much impossible -- to do.


 Hillary 
I i don't know. I never really got the whole -- watching it on ~TV and
and getting into the whole -- mystery of it because, in the end, the
woman's dead and so is her child and -- and -- there's -- really no way of
changing that I guess.


 Kelly 
Yeah, uh, I think it's kind of strange how it was so publicized.  Like
I'm just, seriously, like I don't, like I try not to watch, like -- too
much, like


 Hillary 
You can't help it sometimes.


 Kelly 
Yeah I know.  But it just amazes me that, uh, I think it's ridiculous
how publicized -- how much publicity it got because -- I mean there's like
human rights violations going on all around the world. I mean there's
like, genocide in <PLACE country="SD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19985421" id="Pl-4" latLong="15.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Sudan</PLACE> right now but like, nobody talks about that.
That's like (())


 Hillary 
Oh yeah and what's going on in, I know and people -- flock, flock to the
store to buy all their -- all their foreign made goods and it's like
what are you -- doing? Obviously they don't really care about what's
going on. They just like to hear the details.  Maybe if they could
hear the details about other things they would be more involved. I
don't know.


 Kelly 
Um (()) it's almost like, uh -- (()) diversion but it just seems like
they just make it into like, like a soap opera for people to watch,
you know?


 Hillary 
Well you know, some people were glued to their ~TVs for weeks,  and
it's just to disturbing that that would be their -- their main
entertainment during the day.


 Kelly 
Oh yeah, definitely. It's creepy.


 Hillary 
Especially when there's so many other things they could be doing. We
have three kids. I could not sit around all day and watch a murder
trial on ~TV, especially with my kids around.
