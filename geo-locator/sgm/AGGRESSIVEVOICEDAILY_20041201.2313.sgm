Not to be Ignored

More than a few e-mails have come in wondering why I haven't remarked
on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that left six people dead,
and why I haven't updated the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER.

I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the
issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and
everything that goes along with it. This is problem that needs to be
addressed.

But as for the assault weapons ban issue, the man accused of the
brutal killings, Chai Vang of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:663851" id="Pl-1" latLong="44.944°N 93.093°W" state="US-MN" type="PPL">St. Paul</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:663849" id="Pl-2" latLong="46.250°N 94.250°W" state="US-MN" type="CIVIL">Minn</PLACE>, used a <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE>-built Saiga
7.62 mm, SKS semiautomatic rifle.

As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of
banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain &quot;assault weapons&quot;
signed by President Clinton. The ban expired in September and at the
time of this posting, no one has been killed by any one of those weapons
since the ban expired.

But let's talk about this case, as I'm sure discussions have started
and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident. While
the media use words like &quot;military style,&quot; &quot;assault&quot; and
&quot;semiautomatic,&quot; the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typical
hunting rifle.

The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round
magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left
hand side of this blog. Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10
rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an &quot;assault&quot;
weapon. So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk
about the person behind the trigger.

If convicted of the killings, Vang faces life in prison as <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:663849" id="Pl-3" latLong="46.250°N 94.250°W" state="US-MN" type="CIVIL">Minnesota</PLACE>
does not honor the death penalty. I look forward to Vang's conviction
and I pray for the families of the victims. What happened was
indefensible and justice must be served.
