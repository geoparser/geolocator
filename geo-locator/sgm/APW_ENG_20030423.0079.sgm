<PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19926364" id="Pl-3" latLong="1.367°N 103.800°E" type="COUNTRY">Singapore</PLACE> authorities extended the use of its state-of-the-art
thermal imaging scanner to fight the deadly SARS virus by placing
units at its border with <PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" mod="BORDER" type="COUNTRY">Malaysia</PLACE>.

The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said it began a trial of
the scanners Wednesday at its <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20026475" id="Pl-12" latLong="1.444°N 103.777°E" type="PPL">Woodlands</PLACE> and <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19926275" id="Pl-13" latLong="1.321°N 103.657°E" type="PPL">Tuas</PLACE> checkpoints to
screen for people suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Nine scanners, developed locally for military purposes, were placed
at <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19926364" id="Pl-4" latLong="1.367°N 103.800°E" type="COUNTRY">Singapore</PLACE>'s <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20052940" id="Pl-14" latLong="1.393°N 103.990°E" type="PPL">Changi</PLACE> Airport last week to check people arriving from
SARS-affected countries.

Those who show up on the camera screen as ``hot bodies,'' or with a
temperature greater than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees
Fahrenheit), will be pulled aside.

Each day about 90,000 people cross the border between <PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-10" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Malaysia</PLACE> and
<PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19926364" id="Pl-5" latLong="1.367°N 103.800°E" type="COUNTRY">Singapore</PLACE>. Any person found to be entering <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19926364" id="Pl-6" latLong="1.367°N 103.800°E" type="COUNTRY">Singapore</PLACE> with a high
temperature would be directed to a nearby nurse station for further
checks.

<PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19926364" id="Pl-7" latLong="1.367°N 103.800°E" type="COUNTRY">Singapore</PLACE> has reported 16 deaths, the world's third-highest toll, out
of 186 infected from the flu-like illness. Globally, at least 236
people have died and more than 4,000 have become sickened with the
illness.

Immigration and Checkpoints Authority spokeswoman Ngoon Pei Ling said
during the trial period the scanners would be placed at bus
checkpoints, where passengers are already required to disembark for
immigration purposes.
