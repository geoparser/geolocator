<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> intelligence officials now believe <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> is developing the
technology to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit atop the
<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s growing arsenal of missideS( potentially putting <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19753773" id="Pl-28" latLong="35.685°N 139.751°E" predicative="true" state="JP-13" type="PPLC">Tokyo</PLACE> and
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops based in <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-29" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> at risk, according to officials who have
received the intelligence reports.

In the assessment, which they have shared with <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-30" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>, <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-32" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY">South Korea</PLACE> and
other allies in recent weeks, officials at the Central Intelligence
Agency said that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> satellites have identified a sophisticated new
nuclear testing <PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-495" type="FAC">site</PLACE> in an area called <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" id="Pl-35" type="RGN">Youngdoktong</PLACE>. At the <PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-496" type="FAC">site</PLACE>,
equipment has been set up to test conventional explosives that, when
detonated, could compress a plutonium core and set onfe nuclear
explosion.

[oMa intelligence officials believe that the existence of the testing
<PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-497" type="FAC">range</PLACE> is evidence that the country intends to manufacture much more
sophisticated weapons that would be light enough to put onto its
growing arsenal of medium- and long-range missiles. Previously,
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> officials had said they were uncertain whether <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> had
received enough outside technical help to even attempt to make such a
``miniaturized'' nuclear warhead. The new testing capability would
suggest that the North Koreans are getting closer _ now, officials
said, the intelligence reports say they could do in in as little as a
year or less. But officials say there is no sure way of knowing that
they can until they actually test one.

Senior administration officials say that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-13" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> has been trying
to convince Asiagent that it requires a unified diplomatic front to
force the <PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-25" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> to give up its weapons. The new intelligence is
apparently being marshaled to support the administration's argument.

According to officials who have been briefed on the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-18" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> reports,
conventional explosions simulating a nuclear detonation have been set
off at the testing <PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-498" type="FAC">site</PLACE>, which is near <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>'s main nuclear
<PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-500" type="FAC">complex</PLACE>. <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has never tested a nuclear weapon, though the
CIA long ago estimated that it manufactured two crude devices in the
late 1980s or early 1990s.

<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>, unlike <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-36" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, has made no secret of its plan to develop
nuclear weapons. Now, administration officials say they fear that the
<PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-26" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> is on the verge of producing five or six new weapons, some of
which might be miniaturized.

 ``This would give them the range they never had before, and the
chance to spread their threat far beyond <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-33" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY">South Korea</PLACE>,'' said one
senior <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-41" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">Asian</PLACE> official, noting that approximately 60,000 <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops
are based in <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-31" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>. ``It changes the dynamics of the problem.''

The new intelligence estimates provided to <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-42" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">Asian</PLACE> allies, however,
left it unclear how quickly the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-43" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North</PLACE> could produce the small
warheads. The worst-case estimate, officials say, is that they could
do so in less than a year.

(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> satellites have been watching <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">North Korean</PLACE> nuclear activity
intently since late last year, when the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-44" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North</PLACE> evicted international
inspectors. Those inspectors had stood guard over a collection of
8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods, which can be reprocessed into
weapons-grade plutonium.

In January the <PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-27" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> began to re-start its nuclear rexrOgessing
equipment, which had been mothballed for nearly a decade under a 1994
agreement with the Clinton administration. But according to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
officials, it now appears that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-8" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korean</PLACE> engineers ran into
technical problems in restarting the facilities. While intelligence
officials have reached no consensus, they told allies last week that
in the worst case, only a few hundred of the 8,000 rods had been
converted into plutonium. It would take 1,000 to 1,500 rods to make
enough plutonium for a weapon, experts say.O

``What we are told is that it would take perhaps six months after
that to produce a miniaturized warhead, and put it into one of the
missiles,'' said one senior official who has recently reviewed the
intelligence. ``But after <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-37" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, who knows how good those estimates
are?''

After the claims made about prohibited weapons in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-38" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, which have
not been found so far, skepticism about the quality of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-22" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
intelligence is widespread. And in the case of <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-9" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>, as in
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-39" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, the immediacy of the threat depends on whose analysis seems
most compelling.

So far, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> intelligence has picked up almost no sign of the
telltale krypton gas that is released into the atmosphere when
nuclear fuel rods are converted into weapons-grade plutonium. This
has led some analysts to argue that the North Koreans may be farther
from producing a weapon than feared a few months ago.

But others note that trucks were seen carrying the rods out of their
normal storage <PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-504" type="FAC">area</PLACE> months ago, and it is unclear where they are _ or
even whether the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-46" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> is sniffing for the krypton gas in the
right place.

``We don't believe that the main reprocessing <PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-505" type="FAC">facility</PLACE> has been very
active,'' said one senior administration official in a recent
interview. ``But could there be a second reprocessor? No one knows
for sure.''

Without question, though, <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-10" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>'s capabilities greatly outstrip
anything <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-40" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> has had in the past decade, and <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-11" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>'s program
is probably several years ahead of <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-47" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>'s.

President Bush and <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-34" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY">South Korea</PLACE>'s new president, Roh Moo-h is unclear
whether they interpret the meaning of that phrase the same way. Bush
has said he wants a diplomatic solution to the problem, but would not
foreclose any option, including military options. Roh has said any
pre-emptive strike against the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-45" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North</PLACE>'s nuclear facilities could prove
disastrous.
