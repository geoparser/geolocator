<PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IDGB:16912659" id="Pl-5" latLong="35.672°N 51.424°E" state="07" type="PPLC">TEHRAN</PLACE>, May 4 (AFP)

The pro-reform director of <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-2" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>'s biggest-selling daily newspaper and
official organ of <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IDGB:16912659" id="Pl-6" latLong="35.672°N 51.424°E" state="07" type="PPLC">Tehran</PLACE>'s municipality has stepped down following
the appointment of a conservative as the <PLACE country="IR" form="NOM" gazref="IDGB:16912659" id="Pl-8" latLong="35.672°N 51.424°E" state="07" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>'s new mayor, press
reports said Sunday.

Mohammad Atrianfar, who had headed Hamshahri (Fellow Citizen) since
it was founded a decade ago and was a major backer of reformist
President Mohammed Khatami, explained that he wanted to &quot;leave the
new mayor with a free hand to choose a director&quot; of the paper.

<PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IDGB:16912659" id="Pl-7" latLong="35.672°N 51.424°E" state="07" type="PPLC">Tehran</PLACE> had been governed by reformists since 1989, but a conservative
city council was elected in the February 28 municipal polls in a
result attributed to a meager turnout amid growing public
disillusionment with electoral politics.

Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad, reported to be a hardliner among conservatives,
was appointed mayor on Saturday and a change in Hamshahri's
management -- as well as its editorial line -- has been considered
inevitable given the election result.

Founded by former mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi, Hamshahri was quick
to become <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-3" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>'s biggest-selling daily with a circulation of 450,000.
It also built up healthy finances, carrying scores of pages of
private advertisements daily.
