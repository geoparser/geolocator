1. Future Elections Who do you think should run for President/Vice
President in 2008, and why?  Give details about the people you suggest
- their names, what they do now, and why you think they would do a
good job as President.  Some names that have come up in the press are
Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell, Barak Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Jeb Bush.  What do you think of these candidates? Who would hate to
see run for President in 2008?


 A 
Ah, but yeah, I don't know who should run, I don't think Hillary can
uh can make it, to be honest with you.


 B 
Don't you? She would be my s- -- well you know what, actually, I liked
Dean a lot I must say, in this election. And I think it was just


 A 
Yeah.  Yeah.


 B 
stupid how much flack he got. Like I just -- I like the idea of
bringing in somebody


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
with a -- fresh, with a different perspective, who wasn't already just
part of that whole political wheel.


 A 
Right.  Yeah.


 B 
You know, because I think by the time they get to office, it really
doesn't really matter who is, you know,


 A 
Yeah, they're still under the gun of the same big


 B 
who's in there. They're so


 A 
corporate giants or whatever.


 B 
Well, that's right, that's right. So um


 A 
Mhm.


 B 
Yeah, so I don't know I w- I was quite excited to have somebody that
was coming from a really different perspective. But that got shot out
of the water.


 A 
Mhm hm.


 B 
I I like Hillary. I I


 A 
Yeah.  Yeah.  I like her, she's my Senator, of course.


 B 
Well, of course. That's right.


 A 
But I don't I don't think she could make it.


 B 
And I think she's a -- I mean she's a strong woman, you know in terms
of having


 A 
Mhm.  Mhm.


 B 
a a woman, potentially, as President, I mean, I think she's the
strongest


 A 
Do some reading


 B 
candidate we've had in a long time.


 A 
Do s- -- Do some reading on the governors,  of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:898535" id="Pl-1" latLong="34.500°N 106.000°W" state="US-NM" type="CIVIL">New Mexico</PLACE>, or is it

 B 
Oh, really?


 A 
Do some reading on those three people, those are some people you
should be really looking uh looking at, if y- if uh


 B 
You're obviously a qu- -- a pretty politically savvy kind of guy,
aren't you?


 A 
Well, I was the one, who just happened to go home back in like
nineteen eighty or something and saw Bill Clinton


 B 
Oh, yeah?


 A 
on on television. He -- we ha- -- I came from a small <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-15" state="US-TN" type="PPL">town</PLACE> in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1326873" id="Pl-5" latLong="35.750°N 86.250°W" state="US-TN" type="CIVIL">Tennessee</PLACE> called <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1297772" id="Pl-6" latLong="36.302°N 88.327°W" state="US-TN" type="PPL">Paris</PLACE>, and there's two stations we can pick up, one


 B 
Okay.


 A 
from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1290178" id="Pl-7" latLong="35.614°N 88.814°W" state="US-TN" type="PPL">Jackson</PLACE>, a little town, and the other was from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1653484" id="Pl-8" latLong="36.166°N 86.784°W" state="US-TN" type="PPL">Nashville</PLACE>, a big
town. So we got most of our ~TV from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1290178" id="Pl-9" latLong="35.614°N 88.814°W" state="US-TN" type="PPL">Jackson</PLACE>,  so I was flipping
through the channels, and I saw this little guy, uh the governor of
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:69085" id="Pl-10" latLong="34.750°N 92.500°W" state="US-AR" type="CIVIL">Arkansas</PLACE> giving a speech.


 B 
Yep.


 A 
I said, that guy could be President.


 B 
Is that right?


 A 
I only heard about -- two minutes of him speaking.  You know, he was
articulate, he was charming, he was young. And I said, that guy could
be president.


 B 
Yep.  Yep.


 A 
And um so then when I heard he was running,  those four years later --
uh, eight years later, whatever it was. Because it was a long time
later.


 B 
Sure.


 A 
I saw him, and I was telling all my friends, oh, vote for vote for
this guy, Bill Clinton, vote for him. They were saying, oh no, no,
that old country -- dump. He don't know nothing. I said, he's a Rhodes
scholar, he's smart.  He's and he's funny and he's good. Oh no, no,
he's too young, and he came from that little, little podunk -- g- uh
<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:69085" id="Pl-11" latLong="34.750°N 92.500°W" state="US-AR" type="CIVIL">state</PLACE> he never did anything. I said, he's going to be President. I was
telling all my friends. I said, you know, and I was before -- they
said, well, I thought you supported George Bush, and I said, well I
did support George Bush, but he doesn't know what he's doing and he
needs to go.  And uh so I says vote for him, vote for him, vote for
him, you know. And they voted for Jerry Brown and all these crazy
people.


 B 
Yeah, that's right.  Oh, is that right?


 A 
And I says, you're just wasting your vote, why are you doing that? He
needs your help.  So I went and volunteered for him and everything,
and -- and I met Hillary, and and Tipper and Al, and and I almost got to
meet him.


 B 
Oh, is that right?  Really?


 A 
Uh-huh. I worked at the Democrats Convention and everything. Uh-huh,
yeah.


 B 
Very cool, very cool.


 A 
And uh it was great, I had a good time, and they


 B 
What great experience.


 A 
Yeah, and they fed us, and had a party for us, all that kind of stuff,
you know. So it was fun. But it worked out. But I think we they better
go back to a governor from like uh


 B 
Well, sure.


 A 
uh <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1028616" id="Pl-12" latLong="35.501°N 80.001°W" state="US-NC" type="CIVIL">North Carolina</PLACE>, or like the one from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:482813" id="Pl-13" latLong="38.500°N 98.500°W" state="US-KS" type="CIVIL">Kansas</PLACE>. She's very tall, she
reminds you of uh Christie Whitman, the governor of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-14" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="NJ" type="CIVIL">New Jersey</PLACE>,
remember her?


 B 
Yep.  Okay?


 A 
She's tall, kind of -- mm bush -- butch.  Ac- kind of. She's uh you
know, like she played basketball or something like that. Real smart,
quiet-spoked but stern, you know.


 B 
Yeah, not not real feminine, yeah.  Eh sure.


 A 
And so I -- she she can give that demeanor that people like in
leaders,  of being the big


 B 
Well, people want to feel secure, right? And who's in that position?
They want to feel that they're trustworthy and honorable, and I think,
you know


 A 
yeah.  Yeah, but


 B 
Clinton did so many fantastic things during his term in office, but he
shot himself on the foot with all of his personal garbage, you know,
and I think that overshadowed how brilliant he was as President.


 A 
Yeah.  It does.
