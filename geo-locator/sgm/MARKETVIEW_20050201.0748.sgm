Off the hook? Give us a break!

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-1" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL">Georgia</PLACE>'s Insurance Commissioner, John Oxendine, claims that Marsh
'got off the hook' -- and you can bet he's got a plan to fix that.
Perhaps the worst feature of Spitzer's Attila the Hun-like sweep through
the financial services industry is his habit of breeding imitators, who
will essentially use his settlement as a benchmark for creating their
own demands. Interestingly enough, this morning's <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="ROAD">Wall Street</PLACE> Journal
reported that Marsh paid a higher fee than they needed to -- that the
$850 million number was agreed upon at the last minute mainly so Marsh
could pay out over a four-year period without admitting guilt. The
rhetoric we're hearing -- that Marsh may have cost customers billions of
dollars -- doesn't match the reality that in a few cases, they
manipulated bids, but that the proven damages thus far involve only a
few million dollars of business priced 5% or 10% higher than it
otherwise would have been. Crazy.

Full Disclosure: I own shares of Marsh, and I would not be
particularly dissapointed if Eliot Spitzer's career took a sudden
nosedive thanks to, say, questions about his business relationship to
money manager and alleged stock manipulator Jim Cramer. Nothing
personal; I just think he's the Fifth Horseman of the fiscal apocalypse,
representing Irresponsible Investing with Wild Abandon.
