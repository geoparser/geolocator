 BLITZER 
Welcome back to LATE EDITION. We return now to my interview earlier today
with the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 BLITZER 
I know during the war, before the war, you were very concerned about the
position of the <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-8" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syrian</PLACE> government, cooperating with Iraqis, having an
open border, if you will. Has the situation improved, especially in the
aftermath now of the secretary of state's meeting with Bashar al-Asad?


 RUMSFELD 
Well, I guess time will tell. I talked to Secretary Powell this morning
on the phone a bit, and it's not, I think you need to let the dust settle
on that. He's, in my judgment, had a visit that was worth doing, and the
president asked him to do it, and it was the right thing to do. We'll see
what progress comes. You know, words are one thing, actions are another.


 BLITZER 
But right now you're open-minded as far as <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-9" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE> on whether they will
crack down on terrorism, take some of the other steps that you want them
to take?


 RUMSFELD 
I know what they've been doing, and it's been unhelpful. I know that
Secretary Powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful,
and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future. In my
view, they were making some unwise decisions previously. What they'll do
after this visit remains to be seen.


 BLITZER 
The secretary of state has written you a letter expressing, apparently,
some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to be
spending, those detained at the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Naval base at <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-10" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER">Guantanamo Bay</PLACE> in
<PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18380782" id="Pl-13" latLong="21.500°N 80.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Cuba</PLACE>, about 600 or so of them. Is there any movement in trying to
determine the fate of these individuals?


 RUMSFELD 
I don't think that's quite accurate as to what he wrote me about.


 BLITZER 
All right, tell me what...


 RUMSFELD 
I think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter-agency
process, where we have all these FBI and Department of Justice and CIA
and DIA, and what have you, involved in interrogating these detainees, it
takes time to find out what intelligence they have. It also takes time to
figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate, and what
Colin and I have been concerned about, both of us, is that it's taking so
long. There are a number of countries, and the Department of State has
the responsibility of dealing with those countries, that have foreign
nationals in <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-12" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER">Gitmo</PLACE>, in <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-11" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER">Guantanamo Bay</PLACE>, <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18380782" id="Pl-14" latLong="21.500°N 80.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Cuba</PLACE>, being detained, and those
countries, understandably, would like to know when they could have those
people.So the inter-agency process takes a great deal of time. Colin and
I are trying to speed up that process, and that's what that's all about.


 BLITZER 
Let me just, a couple of nuggets to sort of wrap up before I let you go.
Victory parades for the troops. I remember covering General Schwarzkopf,
the parades in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-15" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-17" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> after the first <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493586" id="Pl-19" latLong="27.000°N 51.000°E" type="WATER">Gulf</PLACE> War. Do you
want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back, to have
parades in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-18" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-16" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>, elsewhere?


 RUMSFELD 
There's no question but that the troops, the young men and women, did
such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them, and there
will be. And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for
our <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> and for the world, and indeed for the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people, who have
been liberated. What's the best way to do that? In the case of 1991, the
task was to go in and get them out of <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-20" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>, and they did it, and they
were properly greeted coming back to the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>. In this instance,
it was a very different task. It was to remove that regime, and it's part
of a global war on terrorism that is not over. We still have to face the
problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states
that exist, that work with those global networks. And on the one hand we
will, in fact, find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent
of these young men and women, and we'll do it well. Whether it will be
modeled off the 1991 thing, I don't know. I kind of doubt it, because
it's such a different circumstance. Certainly, our war plan was not
modeled off of 1991.


 BLITZER 
One final question on <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-21" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>. If the North Koreans pursue their
nuclear weapons ambitions...


 RUMSFELD 
Yes.


 BLITZER 
... a preemptive strike, is that something that is out there?


 RUMSFELD 
I'm not one who speculates about things like that. I know that back in
the 1990s, in the Clinton administration, Secretary Perry called in the
former secretaries of defense, and we had a discussion, and they clearly
had teed up a military option that they were considering, and they then
at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that
that was not appropriate. But those are very serious issues, and I leave
them for the president.
