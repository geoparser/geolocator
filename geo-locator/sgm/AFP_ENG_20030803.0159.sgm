The holy city of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">Najaf</PLACE>, power base of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s Shiite Muslim majority,
is locked in a silent battle between those prepared to cooperate with
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>-led administration and those who champion resistance.

The struggle by supporters of firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr to push
the religious hierarchy into a more antagonistic approach towards the
Americans has seen three attacks on mainstream clerics in the past
two weeks, sources say.

&quot;Such crimes are aimed at provoking disturbances in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-16" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">town</PLACE>, but the
people have ignored them,&quot; said a son of Ayatollah Mohammad Said
al-Hakim, one of Shiite Islam's top four clerics.

But these pressures &quot;won't make the Hawza change its policy&quot;,
Mohammad Hussein al-Hakim said, stressing that the hierarchy
continued to favour talks as the best way of ending the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>-led
occupation.

However, Sadr, who is himself scion of an illustrious family of
ayatollahs, has openly defied the hierarchy by condemning all contact
with <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> forces.

During the mainly weekly prayers in the nearby town of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897411" id="Pl-17" latLong="32.035°N 44.403°E" state="NA" type="PPL">Kufa</PLACE> Friday,
he demanded the withdrawal of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> troops.

As one of the most outspoken voices of Shiite protest against the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
occupation, he said he was determined to defend the holy sites of
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">Najaf</PLACE> against the Americans, branding it the responsibility of all
Muslims in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

But demonstrators gathered in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">Najaf</PLACE> on Thursday and Friday to protest
against the wave of attacks against mainstream clerics and proclaim
their allegiance to the religious hierarchy.

A theology student, Amjad al-Azari, was beaten with the butt of a
rifle on Tuesday for refusing to drive armed men to Hakim junior's
<PLACE continent="AI" country="IQ" form="NOM" id="P-20" type="FAC">house</PLACE>, a source close to the Hawza said.

Similarly, last Sunday, Sheikh Dia al-Modhaffar, a relative of
Ayatollah Hakim, was beaten black and blue in the <PLACE continent="AI" country="IQ" form="NOM" id="P-22" type="ROAD">street</PLACE> by unknown
assailants.

Supporters of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, another of Shiite Islam's
leading clerics, have also been subject to attacks.

An official from his office, Ibrahim Layez, was admitted to <PLACE continent="AI" country="IQ" form="NOM" id="P-21" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE>
with multiple stab wounds two weeks ago, although he is now said to
be out of danger.

These attacks have been accompanied by &quot;death threats&quot; against the
ayatollahs, said Hakim junior.

Officially, no complaints have been filed, but the ayatollah's son
blames those who see their only hope of power and influence in
&quot;chaos&quot;.

&quot;It must be an outsider, because the population is known for its
allegiance to the Hawza and respect for it is sacrosanct in the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-18" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">town</PLACE>,&quot; he said.

Instead, he pointed the finger at &quot;certain blemishes on the name of
Islam&quot; who collude with the media, in a clear reference to Sadr,
whose sermons are regularly featured on television.

But a spokesman for Sadr denied any role in the violence, dismissing
the allegations as &quot;prejudice&quot;.

&quot;Any attack against a member of the Hawza, be he a dignitary or a
simple student, is unacceptable,&quot; said Sheikh Mustafa Yaqubi.

Yaqubi defended Sadr's opposition to the Americans, although he
acknowledged it had little support among the tribes who still
dominate the countryside.

&quot;They think the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> presence gives them protection but we see the
occupation as more negative than positive. It is not acceptable to
justify the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> occupation in this way,&quot; he said.
