 KELLY WALLACE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera) 
It had been very quiet inside <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-12" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> since the start of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.s.</PLACE>-led war
against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. Many Israelis were fearing that quiet would come to an end.
And it did on this day. Police say a suicide bomber blew himself up
outside this <PLACE country="IL" form="NOM" id="Pl-280" type="FAC">cafe</PLACE>, called The <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-20" latLong="51.500°N 0.117°W" predicative="true" state="GB-ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE> <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" id="Pl-289" type="FAC">Cafe</PLACE>, earlier Sunday afternoon. We
can show you some pictures from earlier Sunday. People here tell us the
<PLACE country="IL" form="NOM" id="Pl-282" type="FAC">cafe</PLACE> was filled with people enjoying the spring weather. Many here though
say they are relieved only one person dead, the suicide bomber. Dozens,
though, injured, including some <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-13" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> soldiers, because according to an
eyewitness, he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the spring
weather.

Then it was big bomb. And many soldier. Two soldiers were down here. Many
blood. Many people skip from here. Big paranoia.


 WALLACE 
There had been many terrorist attacks here in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219140" id="Pl-18" latLong="32.334°N 34.858°E" state="IL-M" type="PPL">Netanya</PLACE>, including the
deadliest suicide bombing ever in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-14" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> almost exactly a year ago, March
27, at the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" id="Pl-288" type="FAC">Park Hotel</PLACE> during Passover, 29 people killed in that attack.
As for this attack, the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-21" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> militant group Islamic Jihad is
claiming responsibility. According to a leaflet from the group obtained
by CNN, the group says the attack was to show the union of Palestinians
with the people of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. The group is also claiming that Islamic Jihad
militants are already inside <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> to carry out attacks against <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-22" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces. <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-15" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> has been on a heightened state of alert since the
start of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>-led war against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. And now many Israelis fear they
could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military
campaign against Saddam Hussein continues. I'm Kelly Wallace, CNN,
reporting from <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219140" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.334°N 34.858°E" state="IL-M" type="PPL">Netanyahu</PLACE>, <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-16" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>.
