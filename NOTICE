The package also includes a stand-alone indexing tool for generating gazetteer index. It bundles apache lucene inside.
The version is   Apache lucene core 3.6.2 and lucene analyzers 3.1.0(http://lucene.apache.org/core/) for bulding the gazetteer index and querying it.

ark-tweet-nlp are bundled in the distribution, because they use an older version of lucene, which conflicts with the newer version.
